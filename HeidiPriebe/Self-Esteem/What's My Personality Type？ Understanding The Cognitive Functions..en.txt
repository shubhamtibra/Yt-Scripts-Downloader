[Music]
am i more of a jerk
or an idiot
[Music]
i mean i guess
[Applause]
she pressed jerk that seems wrong
i mean my records don't reflect an
abundance of unkind behavior
i could be unkind you don't really know
me
you can ignore introverted feelings she
just likes to think of herself as tough
i mean sometimes depends on what kind of
mood i'm in
look we all contain multitudes i totally
get that i just wish that there was an
easy way for me to visualize my own
psyche so that i could understand it
without getting lost in all of the
nuances
i'm gonna spare you my ted talk on
archetypes in the meantime come with me
there are eight people i think it's
gonna help you to meet hi we're the
extroverted department of your brain
my role is to keep you tuned into how
other people are thinking and feeling
and help you respond appropriately to
them i'm responsible for helping you to
set meaningful goals
and then reach them i help you
understand how everything in your
environment is connected to everything
else in your environment
and i keep you tuned in to all of the
possibilities that exist for you in your
environment in every single
moment cool so um we're the introverted
department
i'm responsible for keeping your inner
world logically consistent
and i keep it filled with deep and rich
emotion
i observe the mind itself and i help you
notice patterns within your own psyche
and i reflect on everything that brought
us here which helps you understand what
to trust and not trust in the future
[Music]
i just don't think i fit into any of
these personality type boxes you know
like think of all the times i've
reinvented myself over the years i'm a
new person every two years
yes you have displayed a stable and
consistent desire for exploration over
the course of your life
it's almost like that is a part of your
personality
[Music]
well here it is the course that's going
to tell us the truth about who we are
should we take it always
you
