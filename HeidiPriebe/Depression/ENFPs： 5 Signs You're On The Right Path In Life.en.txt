hey guys happy sunday i just filmed a 45
minute video
with no sound like the sound cut out
within two minutes
so i'm going through this process
currently of like trying to convince
myself that i hated that video and that
it was very bad and i was gonna refilm
it anyways
so i'm gonna be um
emotionally dealing with that for a few
minutes and then we're gonna get started
okay i have much more to say now than i
did
in the previous 45 minute period today
we're going to be talking about
purpose as an enfp and purpose is this
term that i personally kind of hate like
i feel like it's
a made-up term and whenever you have a
made-up term it's really easy to
manipulate that term
and to get other people to do things
they don't necessarily want to do
because you're promising them something
that isn't actually
real i studied psychology for a lot of
years and it's
an important field that i'm glad we have
but i also think there
is this phenomenon in the field of
mental health where we blame
every single problem that someone has on
themselves and their mindset
when in reality a lot of the time the
problem is that there's a mismatch
between the self
and the environment so you're just not
in a place
that feels good or authentic or right
for you and that's providing you with
the things that you need based on the
person that you
are and psychology can get stuck in the
trap of trying to fit the person to the
environment and going okay well if
you're
working in nine to five and your basic
needs are covered and you have you know
a couple people in your life who you can
relate to
then you should be happy and if you're
not happy you're sick and that's not
always the case
a lot of the time we're trying to like
psychoanalyze or medicate people into a
life that just
isn't authentic or genuine for them and
that's not to say that we never need
either medication or psychoanalysis but
i think a lot of the time especially
for intuitive types they're just living
lives that aren't really aligned with
who they actually are and how their mind
actually works because the world was
built
for people who are not like us because
statistically we're a much smaller
percentage of the population
so we have to find other routes to
growth and fulfillment and they're going
to look very different than they are for
the average person so today
when i say purpose or being on your
purpose or being on your path in life
what i mean is
living in a way that is in alignment
with who you actually are as a person
and what actually brings you to life so
your purpose is whatever makes you feel
really alive really engaged with being
alive like you wake up in the morning
and you're excited that you exist that
day
that is your purpose that's what i'm
talking about when i talk about purpose
i'm talking about that feeling
of aliveness and vitality and alignment
with your life
so please don't mistake this for me
telling you that you need to find like
significance through working the same
job for 40 years or getting married at a
certain age or whatever
i'm not going to tell you any of that
today we're going to talk about
specifically
why you need your own definition of
those things so tony robbins who a lot
of people think is an enfp i don't
really know i haven't watched enough of
his videos to be able to make that
assessment myself
but he has these six basic human needs
that he believes everyone needs to feel
fulfilled
and those needs are certainty
uncertainty significance
connection slash love growth and
contribution it's hard to put this
finger up
without putting this finger up and i
think that a lot of people that we meet
growing up
really have that certainty need so that
need for life to be kind of headed in a
singular
certain direction and to know that
everything's going to work out a certain
way
especially if you value sensing there
tends to be a strong need for certainty
in your world view
sensing perceivers less so um but
sensing judgers very much so so if
you're an enfp or any other
np type that's grown up in a society
that really really values certainty
you might not realize just how big your
need for uncertainty is
and uncertainty doesn't necessarily mean
that your life is in shambles it doesn't
mean like you don't have a home to live
in or you don't have anything kind of
figured out
it just means that there's a lot of new
stuff happening for you so there's a lot
of new ideas that you're going through
or
feelings that you're feeling or things
that you're exploring i think that np
types tend to have
incredibly high needs for uncertainty
but we don't always value that need for
uncertainty because we don't really see
it as a need we see it as like something
that's flawed or broken in us
so step one of kind of finding your
purpose as an enfp
is accepting what your needs are you
will never feel aligned with your life
or excited about your life or like
you're on the right path
if you are denying what you actually
need to be happy and fulfilled
but what we're going to talk about is
what it's going to feel like so kind of
some guideposts that you'll be hitting
if you are living in alignment with your
purpose because i see a lot of people
kind of working these jobs that they
hate being in these relationships
they're unhappy with and they're like oh
well maybe this is my purpose
no if you hate it it's not your purpose
so that is point number one
the number one guidepost or kind of sign
that you are living in alignment with
your purpose as an enfp is that you
aren't
bored constantly the enfp's greatest
strength
is the amount of information we're able
to take in and
analyze and understand and convey to
other people in a very simple and
straightforward way
and if your mind is not actively engaged
in the process of doing that and you
feel like you're just thinking the same
thoughts over and over and over again
it's becoming mind-numbing
you are not living in alignment with
your purpose you are on some
that is absolutely not what you were
here to do because what you are here to
do
is feel excited about being alive is
taking in a ton of new information
learning new things growing in new ways
and then conveying that growth to other
people
tim ferriss who i believe is an entp
once said the opposite of happiness is
not sadness it's boredom and i think
that that
is so true for enp types maybe any of
the np types because when we are
intellectually stimulated and we're
excited by new ideas and our brains are
full of new things to think about and
chew on
we are so productive we are so
charismatic we are like these
balls of energy and purpose if you
are pushing down the things that make
you excited because you want acceptance
or because
you want steady work or because you want
some form of validation that you feel
like you can only get
by hiding who you are you are absolutely
throwing away what you are here to do
which is to learn to grow to share to
connect on those things
and that leads me to point number two so
guidepost number two for telling that
you're living in alignment with your
purpose as an enfp
is that you are attracting people to you
who are like you
so if you want to know what kind of
energy you're giving off look at the
people around you
who are you surrounded by who are your
friends who are your colleagues who do
you talk to the most on a day-to-day
basis
when you are so engaged with the things
that you love with the ideas that you
want to share
with the adventures that you want to
have you will naturally find yourself
surrounded by other people who are
really engaged with those things as well
because you are putting that out into
the world and allowing other people
to find you and connect with you on it
so i spent years of my life
not engaged with any of the things that
i loved because when i was younger i
just thought i had to grow up into this
like sj
ideal because my entire family was sj
types and there's nothing wrong with the
sji deal if you're an sj
right like most of the people in my
family are like bankers or government
workers or whatever
and that's totally fine but it was not
the life that i wanted so growing up i
would kind of end up in these scenarios
where i was like okay people approve of
me
but like my friends are not similar to
me my family is not similar to me i'm
not really interacting with anyone on a
day-to-day basis who's
like me and i kind of had this epiphany
at a certain point where i was like
where are the people like me they're
probably out there
doing the things that i don't have the
balls to do because they're just
living as the people that they are so i
started traveling
i started freelance writing i started
talking about the things that i was
really interested in and engaged with
and oh my god people who are like me
showed up everywhere
as soon as i started traveling i made
all of these perceiver friends who just
wanted
every day of their life to look
different than the day before as soon as
i started talking a lot about typology
i got this entire internet community of
people who love typology
and as soon as i started going after the
kind of life that i wanted
i found more and more people who were
also going after the lives that they
wanted and that ambition
was very exciting to be around it feels
really good to be around people who want
similar things to you and who can kind
of walk down that path with you if
your environment's full of people who
don't understand you you might want to
look at yourself as the common
denominator there
what are you hiding what are you not
putting out there to allow people to
connect with you on
that you're secretly thinking about or
wishing you had some connection points
on
so if you can be brave enough if you can
be honest enough with yourself to start
pursuing what you know in your gut
you're here to pursue
i promise you other people will start
showing up on your path
to encourage you that you're on the
right route it happens
not by magic but because people are just
drawn to people who share their world
views so if you're putting yourself
out there other people are going to be
able to see that and to come find those
connection points with you in a way that
they're never gonna be able
to do if you're keeping yourself hidden
sign number three that you're living in
alignment with your purpose as an enfp
the bad days still feel meaningful
today i recorded a 45 minute video with
no mic on and that was
so annoying but it was nowhere near as
annoying
as it would have been if i were
recording a video that i felt no passion
about
if anything this felt like oh this is my
opportunity
to do it even better and with even more
enthusiasm because i can learn from the
first time around so when i was in
university i had an enfp professor one
year who taught a class on building
healthy relationships he was like an
ex-marriage and family therapist and
something he used to say that i loved
so much was people stay in bad
situations whether that's bad
relationships
bad jobs whatever it is because they
don't understand the difference between
growing pain
and pain pain and what he meant by that
was that certain challenges in our life
certain difficult things we come across
certain problems that we have bring us
to a better place so we go
through them and we find ways to move
through them as effectively as possible
because we know
that they're bringing us to somewhere we
want to be it's literally like
breaking down our muscles so that they
can build back stronger when we start
weight training
but pain pain is just suffering so the
problems are challenges in our lives
that bring us nowhere they just keep us
trapped in this
never-ending cycle of suffering and pain
and self-neglect and if you can learn to
tell the difference
between which of your problems are
growing you and bringing you closer and
closer to a place you want to be
versus which of your challenges are
doing nothing but draining you
of your energy and vitality it's going
to become a whole lot easier to realize
which paths you should be walking down
and which ones you should just leave
behind forever
which problems do you like having is one
of the best questions you can ever ask
yourself in life
mark manson has a piece on this i also i
know he tests intp
but i would bet my entire family's life
on enfp for him
and he has this whole piece on like what
kind of sandwich do you want to eat
in your life but
that's really what it is like figure out
what you love
so much that you will do anything to get
that thing
and that all of the little obstacles
that stand in your way of that thing
don't feel as tedious because you know
that you're on the path towards
somewhere you want to go
that's a really really big indication
that you are living in alignment with
whatever version of purpose you believe
to be true for your life you will feel
like even the tedious stuff
is meaningful because it's bringing you
somewhere so signpost number four that
you're probably living in alignment with
your purpose as an enfp
you are thinking less about yourself and
more about the world around you so when
enfps are depressed or feeling down we
have a tendency to kind of over rely on
fi
and by the way if you don't know what
the cognitive functions are or you don't
know what i'm saying when i say like
n-e-f-i-t-e-s-i
i do run a six-week soul boot camp
course for enfp personalities and infp
personalities
where we talk in detail about what the
cognitive functions you use
are and how they show up in different
areas of your life so at work at school
in your relationships we're going to
wake up at 5 a.m read for 20 minutes
journal for 20 minutes meditate for 20
minutes exercise for 20 minutes clean
for 20 minutes dance like no one's
watching for 20 minutes face our fears
for 20 minutes meal prep for 20 minutes
okay okay okay any you know this is my
wet dream but i have to stop you right
there there's no way in hell we're
realistically gonna do this for
any more than like one to two mornings
in a row honestly it seems like annie's
kind of forgotten that it's me who wakes
up first in the morning so
after about two days once the fantasy of
this wears off i'm hitting snooze
so hard so the course is kind of like
watching the movie inside out but for
the enfp brain specifically so you learn
who these kind of characters are who
make up your mind and how they show up
for you and how you can work with those
characters so they're not fighting all
the time
but they're working cohesively and
getting along any i'm going to make this
easy for you to understand
i have been working directly under f5
for a long time now
yeah and you might think you're making
the decisions around here any because
you're coming up with all these
possibilities
but you're not who's actually deciding
on them fi is doing that
so if you come up with an idea that you
love even if i love it
nsi also loves it it's not going to
happen
unless fi loves it and you have to
factor me in
give me a change that i love and i will
enlist te
and we will make it happen consistently
long
term for entire lives if you want you
just
have to stop ignoring me in this process
i am
literally your decision making function
you're right you're right so anyway
auxiliary fi which is our second
cognitive function it's
very introspective it's very
self-analytical it has a great grasp on
self-awareness
but what we can do as enfps is over
indulge fi when we're feeling depressed
and get this almost obsessive idea that
we just look
hard enough if we just crack whatever
code it is that we're struggling to
crack
we will figure out what's wrong with us
but sometimes
the problem is not the self it's the
self in relation to the environment
which we talked a little bit about at
the beginning of this
when enfps are at their best is when
they're engaging
very vastly and very widely and very
enthusiastically with the world
outside of their minds we are extroverts
and we forget that when we're depressed
we forget that when we're feeling down
we forget that when we're burnt out
but we are giant ass ease and we are
supposed to be living in a very
extroverted way
so if you start to find 90 of your
thoughts are very circular very
self-absorbed very obsessed with
figuring out like exactly what's wrong
with you
exactly what's happening inside your
mind exactly what led you to where you
are
there's nothing wrong with doing a
little bit of that but if you're doing a
lot of that
and you're very rarely thinking about
what's going on for other people what's
happening in the world
what opportunities exist for you to
explore in the world outside your mind
you are not living in alignment with
your purpose you're getting stuck in
kind of an fi loop
maybe you need some new adventures maybe
you need some new opportunities maybe
you need to go meet someone who's going
to change the way you think about things
when
enfps are living in alignment with their
purpose they are taking in
humongous amounts of new information our
minds are wired in a way
that very few people's minds are wired
extroverted intuition is a very rare
cognitive function
it really is i've met maybe five other
enfps
four-ish entps in my life not a lot of
people are able to take in the sheer
amount of stimuli
the sheer amount of information that np
types are able to take in
and to make sense of it and the fact
that we have that ability
means that if we are not using it oh my
god
what a waste of an incredible mind so
yes focus on yourself but also notice
when that focus is becoming more
narcissistic than it is growing
so are you focusing on yourself in a way
that is opening more doors for you in a
way that is
leading you to good places where you
want to go or are you just navel gazing
because it feels less scary than going
out and interacting with the world
and i understand that i have been there
way more times than i feel comfortable
admitting but
oh my god it does not serve you and that
brings us to our last signpost that
you're on the right path as an enfp
which is that you do not feel
done you feel like you're in a perpetual
state of learning and growth
so it is so tempting for any type to
want to have arrived somewhere to kind
of go okay
now i'm at this place where i have no
problems i have no challenges i have
nothing i need to tackle i can just kind
of sit back relax and my life feels good
and you know what that's great for like
a month but if it's going on for years
of your life what you're actually doing
is plateauing and that plateau is going
to lead to depression
and when you reach a good place and then
plateau that depression feels really
confusing because it's like wait a
minute i met all my needs i met my goals
i should be happy
this intj friend who's a teacher and he
told me one time about an experiment he
did with his kids
where he asked them to fill up a cup of
water all the way up to the brim
and then walk from the classroom down to
the river that was by their school
without spilling any water
and when they were walking because their
cups were so full
all they could do was focus really
intensely on nothing spilling out of
their cup
and by the time they got down to the
river he was like how was the walk here
did you enjoy it did you see the
beautiful
sights and everyone was like no we're so
worried about our cups not spilling
that we couldn't enjoy anything and
being the intj that he is he explained
to them that that cup is like your ego
and when it's
too full and by your ego being full i
mean having things in your life
that you feel like you can't lose so
let's say you have a really good job or
a really good relationship or whatever
when you're so focused on preserving
those things that you absolutely can't
let anything spill you miss out on your
entire life while it's happening to you
so the best place to be in is to have a
cup that's like three quarters full
because you can walk places you feel
like okay i'm not panicked about not
having anything in my cup
but i'm also not panicked about
something going wrong and losing this
right you can let a little bit of water
spill out you can be in a great place
and then let some change happen let some
things that once felt good
go because they're breeding monotony now
and again the opposite of happiness for
the any dom
is boredom you need room in your cup to
welcome in new things to let yourself do
that without feeling guilty you have to
accept that need for uncertainty you
have to accept that need for growth
you have to be willing to let yourself
put those things at the absolute top of
your priority list
because those are the things that you
need to stay happy long term
it is great to arrive at the mountaintop
of personal or professional
or interpersonal success but it is not
great to live there
it gets lonely and windy up there you
have to let yourself
arrive at one peak and then start
thinking about the next one that does
not make you impractical
it makes you a person who understands
themselves and knows what they need
so my hope for all of us as enfps is not
that we achieve outstanding career
success is not that we find perfect
relationships it's not that our lives go
incredibly smoothly and according to
plan i hope things trip you up
i hope you get confused you get lost you
get disoriented and i hope that the
process of finding your way back
and finding new creative solutions to
all of those problems
brings you to life because you thrive in
uncertainty you
thrive when things are challenging you
thrive when there is not yet an
established route forward and
someone needs to be inventive and find
one that is why
ne exists that is why enfp and entp and
intp and infp personalities were put
into the world to find creative routes
forward i'm going to end this with one
of my other favorite quotes by howard
thurman that goes
don't ask yourself what the world needs
ask yourself what makes you come alive
and then go and do that because what the
world needs is people who have come
alive and that is the entire summary
of what it means to be living out your
purpose as an enfp
come alive because whatever it is
that's happening when you feel the most
vital and the most engaged and the most
inspired by your own life
is exactly what you were put here to do
and i hope that in a million
completely different ways across the
course of your life you find a way to do
that
all right i think that's it for today
now that i know my microphone is working
but again if you are in a place of
self-discovery of growth of wanting new
things to reach out and do and connect
and experience and you're looking for
other people who are on that same path
i do run enfp soul boot camp courses for
this exact purpose
for helping people realize what it is
that makes them feel really invigorated
and excited and alive and what they want
to pursue out of their lives
and so if that's something that you're
interested in exploring at this phase of
your life
you can go to my website at
www.heidipreeb.com
and you can sign up there and hopefully
the next time we talk we'll have a lot
more clarity about what that means for
you
in the meantime thank you guys so much
for watching i love all of you
i hope that whatever phase whatever
season of your life you're in
there's something that you're feeling
really engaged by because that's really
all i can ever hope for us
is that we feel interested in our lives
so let me know what that is in the
comments what are you interested in
right now what's like really exciting
for you i'm super into video making and
attachment styles as you may have
noticed
um but what is it that's lighting you
guys up right now we have such a
wide variety of interests in the enfp
community um so let's share those a
little bit
and i will see you guys if not before
then next sunday
all right no worries
