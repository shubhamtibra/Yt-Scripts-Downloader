hey guys heidi preeb here i decided to
make this video today as
kind of part of my attachment series but
it's not going to be directly about the
attachment styles
so we're not going to talk about the
four styles anxious secure avoid and
fearful avoidant
instead we're going to talk about one
thing that i frequently come back to
when i talk about attachment healing
but that i've never really fleshed out
in detail which is how to build a
relationship with yourself and start
showing up for yourself
in such a way that your attachment style
can begin healing from the inside out
so when i started getting interested and
like curious about healing work and
attachment healing
i would talk to people who were further
along in the process and something i
heard a lot was
i have a great relationship with myself
now i love myself i can depend on myself
and i was always like amazing like love
that for you
just quick question literally
what does that mean like when you say i
have a fantastic relationship with
myself
when you say i learn to love myself i
learned to re-parent myself
i learned to show up for myself in
tangible terms
what did you do to get there because it
always felt very much to me like there
was this gap between the way i knew i
felt about myself and the way that i
wanted to feel and the place that i
wanted to get to
but i didn't know how to bridge it like
words of affirmation don't do anything
for me so i'm not a stand in front of
the mirror and tell myself kind words
kind of person and it's totally cool
if you are but i find that that's the
only type of self-love advice that is
kind of
frequently distributed is like talk
kindly to yourself give yourself nice
words of affirmation
but there's so so so so so much more
to building a relationship with yourself
than just giving yourself
kind words if anything i think that
giving yourself kind words but then not
backing those words up with action can
work against you in terms of building a
relationship with yourself it's
literally the equivalent of let's say
you're dating someone and they're
constantly telling you they love you
they care about you they're there for
you
and then they never show up on time when
you're meant to hang out they criticize
you anytime you say something even a
little tiny bit wrong
they sabotage opportunities for success
that you want to go for
there's a term for that kind of person
and it's a boy
someone of any gender who manipulates
you with their words
and tells you one thing and then does
another don't be that person for
yourself
okay don't add another boy to the world
we have enough of them we don't need
another one
but anyways similar to my last video
this is just going to be a lot of what
has worked for me
so you can feel free to take or leave
whatever advice you feel like would work
for you as well
um everyone processes differently
everyone falls in love with other people
and themselves differently
so this isn't your process that's
totally cool but if there's anything in
here that
feels resonant to you where as you're
listening to it you're like oh
i could use a little bit of love in that
area then i really encourage you to try
implementing it and see what happens
so the number one thing that i think is
incredibly important when you're trying
to build a relationship with anybody but
especially yourself
is having accountability to yourself so
if you're constantly telling yourself i
love you i accept you i believe in you i
want good things for you
but then you're also sleeping through
your alarm every morning eating foods
that make you feel lethargic and unhappy
skipping important events that you
wanted to go to bailing on the plans
that you make with yourself backtracking
on your goals the minute that they get
hard
yourself does not believe you when you
look in the mirror and say i love you
because you've not given yourself any
proof
that that's true so the first step you
have to take is
giving yourself proof that you are going
to show up for yourself why because this
builds self
trust and self accountability and
self-trust is the basis of self-love if
you can't trust yourself to follow
through on any of the things that you
want for yourself
it's very very hard to feel nice kind
happy things towards yourself
and i encourage you to start really
really really small here
if we're always putting this
insurmountable pressure on ourselves
to do huge amounts of work or huge
amounts of change or transformation on
ourselves in short periods of time
we're just going to burn ourselves out
really really quickly and the goal here
is not to
accomplish something humongous the goal
with building self-trust
is literally to just start to get your
mind in the habit
of thinking of yourself as a trustworthy
person so actually the smaller a goal
you can set here the better
pick one thing that you want to do a
very small thing
and then do it for a set period of time
only
because you said you would so when you
are doing something because you want a
certain result
it gets really easy to reason your way
out of that thing as soon as you feel
like oh i found another way to get to
that result
or oh i'm not feeling inspired or
motivated today or oh maybe i don't
really need that end result anyways and
that's what happens a lot of the times
when we set goals and then don't end up
going for them we reason our way out of
the process
but here the goal is different the goal
is not to accomplish
or reach anything it's literally just to
show ourselves
i will show up for myself so when i
decided to take this on i decided that i
was going to
listen to an audiobook while walking to
and from my co-working space every
single day my co-working space
is about an hour away and normally i
have this habit of listening to music
while i walk and i completely dissociate
go into fantasyland and give myself this
kind of unhealthy hit of dopamine by
imagining a life that i'm not actually
living and i really wanted to break that
habit and i wanted to start doing
something healthier for myself
so i decided it would be cool to use
that time to learn instead of dissociate
so i decided i'm gonna do this for five
days and day one and two felt really
great
day three the morning was great the
afternoon i noticed i was losing my
focus as i was walking home and i would
have to continuously bring my attention
back
and day four and five were a lot harder
so in the afternoons because i was
already pretty mentally spent by the end
of the week
i was having a really hard time keeping
my focus on the audiobook rather than
wanting to kind of go off into
fantasyland while i was walking
and if i had been reasoning with myself
i would have gone okay
well my focus isn't really here i'm not
optimizing my attention i might as well
let my attention wander
for let's say two walks out of the five
and then i'll have a pretty even balance
of educating myself
and also allowing my brain kind of room
to breathe and do its natural thing
and that's pretty reasonable but i
didn't let myself do it because the
point of me
implementing these reading and walking
sessions was not to stalk my brain
up with as much knowledge as possible it
was to prove to myself
i'm capable of fulfilling a promise that
i made myself so i told myself at the
beginning after five days i'll
reevaluate
and the next week if something about
this routine isn't working for me or it
needs tweaking then i'll change the
promise i make to myself maybe i'll say
okay three days out of five
you have to listen to an audio book to
and from your co-working space and two
days out of five on the way home you can
listen to music or shop
and that's totally fine you can adapt
this promise to yourself as you go along
but the whole entire point is doing what
you said you would do
solely because you said you would do it
you need to train your brain
to trust yourself and it won't trust you
until you give yourself proof that you
are trustworthy because you do the
things you say you'll do
in the book atomic habits by james clear
he talks about setting
a goal that just puts you in motion but
doesn't actually drive you towards
anything meaningful right away so he
talks about giving his clients goals
let's say they want to start going to
the gym and exercising more he's like
for the first week
just drive to the gym and work out for
five minutes
and then drive home don't let yourself
do a longer workout than that because
the mental resistance around going to
the gym for five minutes
is very low the mental resistance around
going to the gym for two hours
is probably very high but the important
part right away
is not at all to worry about the
progress it's just to worry about
building that self accountability so
that you can look at yourself and go
i know i will do the things i said that
i will do
and the cool thing is it doesn't take
that long after a couple of weeks of
keeping these little promises to
yourself you start trusting yourself
more and that self-trust
takes away anxiety it takes away stress
it takes away that part of your brain
that's always beating itself up because
it doesn't know whether
it is or is not going to do the things
that said it was going to do building
self-trust is the
absolute basis of self-love just like
trust between people is the basis of a
healthy relationship so that's step one
with learning to build a relationship
with yourself and it's the most
important step
step two and this is gonna be a really
difficult one if you're insecurely
attached in any form so if you're
anxious avoidant or fearful avoidant
you have to start learning where your
boundaries are
both with other people and with yourself
and you have to learn the feeling
of what it's like in your body when a
boundary has been crossed
and what's interesting is that i feel
like the responses around boundaries are
kind of polarized for different
attachment styles like anxious people
might feel like they have a really hard
time keeping their boundaries
avoidant people might feel like they
have a lot of boundaries not realizing
that
avoiding others and avoiding situations
you don't want to be in is not setting a
boundary fearful avoidance will struggle
with both ends of that spectrum
probably the next video i make on
attachment style is going to be
attachment styles and boundaries because
it is a giant wealth of information
but for any of these types a really
really important practice you can get
into
is just noticing the physical feeling in
your
body of what happens when a boundary has
been crossed so for me it can show up in
a couple different ways if a boundary
has been crossed in a way that pushes me
into my anxious energy as a fearful
avoidant
i will feel like my entire body is on
fire like i will do
anything on the planet to get someone to
pay attention to me um for me it usually
feels like
blind rage i know for others it can feel
more like a fond response so they feel
desperate to get attention or validation
of some sort
and when i am in my avoidant responses
because i do tend to lean more
towards the dismissive avoidance side of
the spectrum i will suddenly find myself
criticizing other people so i'll be
thinking about someone who normally i
love and enjoy the company of and all of
a sudden i hate the way they breathe
i hate everything they say i start
fantasizing about cutting them out of my
life and never talking to them again
i don't want anything to do with someone
who normally i want quite a bit to do
with
and that's how i know okay some boundary
has been crossed somewhere that's pushed
me into either my inner or outer critics
that inner critic
is a part of the self that is
self-abandoning and that wants to go get
love validation
care from other people because we don't
know how to give it to ourselves so
for me it's that body on fire feeling i
don't know what it is for you
and our outer critic is that part of
ourselves that thinks only i'm okay
everyone else is a mess and i need to
push everybody away so that i can
self-soothe and feel okay on my own
and when i tell you that it took me 30
years
to start realizing how many boundaries i
have that i'm not aware of
to recognize how many behaviors in other
people i'm not okay with engaging with
and to realize
how many bad situations i was putting
myself in
and then hating myself for afterwards i
promise you
it is a long exhaustive process that
takes a while to realize so don't feel
bad
if you currently don't really have a big
awareness about where your boundaries
are
it's gonna come to you but the thing you
have to do is start paying attention to
your body
and noticing when your body is reacting
in extreme ways
because if you're continuously allowing
your own boundaries to be crossed
you will on some deeply unconscious
level absolutely hate yourself for that
i promise you and the fact that you
didn't learn to set boundaries is not
your fault
very early on if you're insecurely
attached you probably
adapted properly to the environment that
you were raised in by not having proper
or clear boundaries but now you have the
opportunity to do something different
so you need to get really clear on what
it feels like when a boundary has been
crossed inside of your body
and then how you can respond in a loving
way to yourself
when that boundary has been crossed so
that does not mean
going out and trying to get someone else
to fix it for you and make you feel
better
it does not mean cutting someone out of
your life and just making the problem go
away by avoiding it
it means taking time to center yourself
get clear on what you need
that you can give yourself and then
understand which boundaries you need to
set
whether those are behavioral boundaries
thought boundaries
emotional boundaries and you need to
find a way to put yourself
in better situations and again we're
going to talk a lot more in a future
video about what a boundary is a lot of
people think
a boundary is an expectation you place
on someone else you tell them you have
to do this
and that's not really what a boundary is
a boundary is all about yourself
and which situations you will and will
not place yourself in
i used to make these kind of rules with
myself when i was in bad situations
where i'd be like okay if this certain
bad behavior happens
five more times then i'll remove myself
from the situation
and i would make these excuses over and
over and over and over again
of why it was okay to keep trying or
keep engaging with a situation that i
knew was really really bad for me
and my life did not change my
relationship to myself did not change
until i sat down with myself one day and
asked myself how many more times is okay
for me to put myself in situations where
i am physically or emotionally
unsafe and i listened to my intuition
and it told me
no more times no more times in your life
every time for the rest of your life if
you want me to start trusting you
you have to immediately take yourself
out of situations
that are not safe or okay for you and
man
it's awkward i have had to ask someone
to pull over the car on the side of the
highway and let me out of the car
i've had to change flights and travel
plans to
start removing yourself from situations
that are unhealthy for you
you need an awareness of your boundary
and you have to be willing to respect
your own boundary
which brings us to point number three
which is that you have to develop a deep
awareness
of why you are continuously crossing
your own boundaries
it is not anybody else's job to uphold
your boundary for you
okay if it were that would be an
absolute mess
because all of your well-being would lie
in everybody else's hands
and man that does not work the problem
is
a lot of us put our unfulfilled needs on
the other side of our boundaries so what
does that mean
let's say i don't really love or respect
myself very much
and the only way i know how to get that
feeling of love and care and respect
is from someone else so now when that
someone else crosses my boundary i'm in
a pickle
because i want to set a boundary and i
want to show up for and respect myself
but i'm going to feel like trash until
that other person gives me the
validation i need
so i'm in a really sticky situation and
the only way to get out of this
situation
is to realize what it is that i was
getting from that other person
and find a way to give it to myself in a
safer way
so you have to find a way to start
meeting your own needs in a way that
does not involve that other and i do
have a video called self-love in the
five love languages that talks a lot
about how we can give ourselves love
through whatever our dominant love
language is and a lot of those practices
are what i personally turn to during
times like this when i feel like a
boundary's been crossed
i need to step back identify what the
boundary is and also what
feeling is burning in my body right now
right
maybe i want attention care and
validation or maybe i want respect and
acknowledgement
and i have to find a way to validate
that feeling within myself
and figure out what i need to give
myself to restore myself to equilibrium
without allowing that boundary to be
crossed again
under every crossed boundary is an
unfulfilled need
okay let's say you come home one day and
your partner hasn't done the dishes and
you're really frustrated all of a sudden
you're having all these negative
thoughts about your partner and you
realize
a boundary has been crossed maybe i'm
not feeling respected or you're feeling
like the rules that we agreed upon were
not followed
and then let's say you get passive
aggressive and just do the dishes
without talking to your partner about it
that's crossing your own boundary
why did you do it maybe because you
don't want to have a confrontation with
your partner
because you have this unfulfilled need
for peace so you're willing to cross
a lot of your own boundaries in order to
feel an instant hit of that sense of
peace
rather than setting up clear rules that
allow you to have that sense of peace
more consistently
or let's say someone said something to
you that really offended you and you
really didn't like it
and you don't speak up you don't let
them know that that wasn't okay you
don't remove yourself from the situation
maybe you have an unfulfilled need for
approval and that person is giving you
approval in other areas so you can't
speak up for yourself and that's
crossing your own boundaries because
you're valuing your own need for
approval
over your need for self-respect so in
both these situations
what's needed is a different way of
fulfilling those unfulfilled needs
so this process is three steps one is
taking a step back
recognizing and acknowledging the
feeling of oh my boundary
has been crossed two asking yourself
which
unfulfilled need allowed me to let that
boundary violation happen
and three how can i fulfill this need in
a way that does not cross my boundaries
and i actually think that setting
interpersonal boundaries should actually
be the last step
because if we jump too quickly into that
a lot of the time what we're trying to
do
is preserve a relationship that needs
some changing
without having fully thought through
what's going wrong is this person
healthy for me is this situation safe
for me to be in physically emotionally
and mentally
and could i get this need met in a
healthier way and once those conditions
are considered then you can set
healthier boundaries but more often than
not you need some time to think those
things through
and especially to focus on the where
else could i get this need met part
because once you figure that part out
you realize that you never have to
demand respect from someone else
you never have to beg someone to follow
your boundary you never have to get
extremely livid when setting a boundary
you can simply walk away
from the people who are not being
respectful towards you because you have
another source of that unfulfilled need
somewhere else
it takes time to get there but it is
potentially
the most important part of attachment
healing is learning that
you will show up for yourself and
respect your own boundaries
100 of the time that's what healthy
relationships are based on
self-love tool number four and this one
is a little bit less concrete and more
abstract
but it's learning to divorce fault from
responsibility
so there are two kind of traps of
thinking that i see a lot of insecurely
attached people falling into
option one is thinking that everything
that is
not your fault is not your
responsibility to fix
and the flip side of it number two is
thinking that everything that is your
responsibility to fix
is also your fault fault and
responsibility
are not the same thing and we have to
look at each one individually in order
to figure out which actions are
important for us to take so i'll give
you an example situation one thinking
everything that is not my fault is not
my responsibility to fix
so this is the mindset we can fall into
if we start using our past
negative experiences and challenges and
traumas as excuses
to treat other people badly for example
people on the anxiously attached
spectrum might feel like because
there is this kind of hole inside of
them where they need so much love and so
much care and so much attention
and they really do that's real they did
not get that consistent caretaker
bonding that they should have had as a
young child
and that's not their fault they think
that it's not their responsibility to
fix that now they have to find someone
they have to get saviored by someone
who can fill that hole inside of them
and again that's kind of an unconscious
one like you're not going to be
consciously thinking that
but it will allow you to justify a lot
of bad behavior
anytime your partner is upset with you
you won't want to give your partner
the authentic experience of their own
emotions you'll want to manipulate and
change their feelings so that they feel
positively towards you
it is not your fault that you're in pain
but it
is your responsibility to fix that pain
for yourself
and that sucks and i am
so sorry if this is you that that has
happened to you
and that the life conditions that you
have been through and the way that
you've grown up
did not give you the full wholehearted
experience of
love and care and acceptance and
belonging that you deserve as a human
being and you do deserve that however
you cannot
manipulate your way into getting it you
have to
take responsibility for showing up for
yourself and
learning to heal that wound inside of
yourself from the inside out
okay not your fault yes your
responsibility
now the flip side of this which you
might see more in avoidance spectrum
types though really this could be
internalized by absolutely any style
is everything that is my responsibility
to fix
is also my fault and the way this plays
out is by
overtaking responsibility for your life
and refusing to allow yourself
access to the softer and kinder and more
forgiving emotions
of things like grief and pain and
self-compassion
because you recognize very clearly no
one's on their way to save me from my
life
if i want to make a change i'm going to
have to be the one who makes it and it's
my responsibility
to turn things around for myself and
what comes paired with that thinking
is the idea that if i'm responsible for
changing this it must be
because on some level it's my fault that
i got into this mess
and what i don't see avoidance spectrum
types doing very often because it is
so deeply so deeply ingrained in their
neurological makeup to think this way
is recognizing that it is not
their fault that they ended up where
they ended up in life
that they really did have difficult life
conditions early on
that gave them challenges to deal with
later on in life that other people don't
have to deal with
grief work and self-compassion is very
difficult for avoidance spectrum types
because they survived early on by
hardening themselves and believing that
i am the cause of all my own problems
therefore i can solve all my own
problems and here is
the magical part of this you can accept
that you were not the cause of all of
your problems that it's not your fault
that you ended up where you did in life
and also
take responsibility for whatever happens
next and
all of the insecurely attached types
need to find
the balance and the fusion of these two
philosophies not my fault
yes my responsibility to change is the
attitude that gets you out of the ditch
of a broken insecure attachment style
and to start acting on that attitude you
have to be very deliberate
about parsing apart fault and
responsibility they're two different
things
and letting go of fault means grieving
the childhood that you never had
grieving the person that your broken
attachment system did not allow you to
become until this point
and then responsibility means
consciously and purposefully creating
whoever you become next the last piece
of advice that i would give when it
comes to building a healthy and honest
relationship with yourself
is open a direct line of communication
with yourself
okay so imagine that you're running a
company and on day one of the company
you just tell everyone okay
start working work hard and then you
check in with them like
maybe twice a year when something goes
really wrong
your employees are not going to
understand when they're making little
mistakes that are setting them off
course they're not going to understand
whether or not performance objectives
are being met they're not going to
understand what's expected of them and
then when they make a mistake they're
going to feel like garbage because no
one
carefully and lovingly checked in with
them and guided them in the proper
direction
to build a relationship with yourself
that is stable and long-lasting
you have to open a direct line of
communication with yourself
that you regularly and systematically
use to check in with yourself
and i want to encourage you to keep this
line of communication
as neutral as humanly possible so this
is where mindfulness comes in
i'm not asking you to judge or evaluate
your own performance
all i'm asking you to do is notice every
single day
in some sort of formalized way what went
really well for me today
what didn't go so well for me today when
did i feel happy and energized and full
of life
and when did i feel angry or frustrated
or like my boundaries were being crossed
you need to start noticing which
sensations are regularly arising in your
psyche
and what those sensations are connected
to in your environment or in your
internal state
so that you can understand what changes
you need to make in your own life in
order to build a better relationship
with yourself
so i personally use a journal called the
five minute journal it's gonna sound
like i'm doing an
ad for them this is not sponsored in any
way i just love this journal so much
and every morning it asks you to list
three things you're grateful for and
then list
three things that you could do that you
give yourself the option to do to make
the day really great and then at the end
of the day you come back you check in
with yourself and you write three things
that happened that day that were great
that you really enjoyed
and then one thing you could have done
to make the day better and i really
liked the way that they were that
because it's not what did you do
wrong today it's what would have been
better if you had done it today so let's
say there's a day where i set out to do
some work and then i got distracted and
didn't do it and i felt this sense of
that work
gnawing at me all day and it annoyed me
through the course of the day and i felt
frustrated
with myself for not doing it what i
could have done better that day
is finishing my work because it impacted
the course of the rest of my day
and i'm not beating myself up in the
process of recording that i could have
done
better by doing my work i'm just
noticing hey
my internal system of thoughts emotions
beliefs behaviors
didn't work so well because it was
disrupted by me not doing my work
so food for thought in the future i
might want to notice that gnawing
sensation of not getting something
done and sit down and do it right away
because i know it's going to negatively
impact the rest of my day
and again that's not me telling myself
you're an idiot you do everything wrong
it's just me noticing
here's something that would make the
system that is me run more smoothly in
the future and you might also be
surprised by
which positive things come up so i
consistently found after a long period
of time that
the more i could respond to myself
noticing
now is not the time to do this piece of
work that i thought i wanted to do
the more time i saved so i ended up
writing multiple days in a row one of
the great things that happened today was
i noticed that i wasn't in a good
workflow and i stopped
and i did something that ended up being
a lot more productive and fulfilling
and the important part here is to just
be extremely
extremely patient with yourself neutral
with yourself
and just get in the habit of noticing
which things
help or hinder your relationship with
yourself learning to observe what makes
you feel a bit mad at yourself
versus what makes you feel really
grateful towards yourself and the
actions you've taken
is gonna make the difference in your
day-to-day life between how much you
like yourself
we dislike people who do things that
make our days difficult and annoying
and we like people who bring joy or
novelty or comfort into our lives
step five is just about noticing what
makes you like yourself and what makes
you not so much like yourself and i
really encourage you to build a routine
around it so sit down for five minutes
every day
and just ask yourself what could i have
done to make this day better
what did i really like about today start
writing it down if it helps
but keep that line of communication with
yourself
about yourself open and consistently
engage in it
you might find out a ton about yourself
that you didn't know and that's the
exciting part of any budding
relationship is
being curious and engaged with the other
person and finding out more and more and
more about them
and as you learn to do that with and for
yourself
your relationship with yourself grows in
incredible strides
so i think that's all i'm gonna go
through today there are many more things
i could put on this list
and many more things i encourage you to
figure out and put on your own list of
how to build a healthy relationship with
yourself
but i just wanted to talk about some of
the things that have been working super
super well for me
in case you're at the point i was once
at where you're like yeah
my relationship with myself could use
some work and i don't know what work to
put into it
this is where i recommend you start
building self trust
understanding your boundaries keeping an
open line of communication with yourself
and just staying as neutral as possible
with yourself in the process we don't
build a healthy relationship by hating
ourselves and we also don't build a
healthy relationship by
over exaggerating our positive qualities
just
observing yourself and getting to know
yourself is the basis of
all of the personal development work
that's going to come next so as per
usual
i'm very curious about your thoughts let
me know in the comments where you're at
with this process
what you found really works for you i
would absolutely love
and we could just share as much as
possible about what makes us feel happy
and at home with ourselves because no
one of us
knows as much as all of us collectively
do so drop your thoughts in the comments
and until next time
i love you guys i love myself i hope you
love yourselves
and i will see you soon
[Music]
you
