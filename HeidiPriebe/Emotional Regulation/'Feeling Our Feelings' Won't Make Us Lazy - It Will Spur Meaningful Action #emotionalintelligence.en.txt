To be attuned to our emotional systems
does not mean only listening to the part
of ourselves that's telling us to stay
in bed all day and be a slob. It means
also listening to the emotions that tell
us, hey, I want to feel good and proud
of myself. So, it's time for me to enact
some discipline or to do some hard work
to get myself to where I want to go.
Those types of signals are also signals
that our emotional systems give us when
we are accurately attuned to them. Our
bodies do not want us to wither away in
bed. Our bodies want us to get up and
live. But we have to be properly attuned
to our bodies and to our emotions in
order to get the whole picture in our
minds.
