all right everyone today we are here
with a very exciting guest
we are here with dario nardi and he is a
neuroscience researcher who is as far as
i'm aware the only person
who's currently doing research into the
intersection between myers-briggs types
and cognitive functions and neuroscience
um so he actually looks at how the mind
responds to stimulation uh based on what
your cognitive functions are and which
type preferences you have so he's a
senior lecturer at ucla
he's been certified in type since 1994.
and if you've been around the type
community for any length of time there
is
an almost 100 chance that you've heard
of this guy that you love his work
uh and if you don't already know and
love him you're about to
um so dario thank you so much for doing
this interview i'm
so excited to have you um so i was
wondering if you could maybe start us
off with just a little bit of
info about what the field of
neuroscience can tell us
about our personality types okay yeah
the thank you so much for having me
um there there's a lot over the past 25
years
and my original training was very much
around what's called action research or
phenomenological research
things like interviewing people to find
out what it's like to be them
in their own words and the brain appears
the hardware
and that's what my equipment can look at
it can look at the activity that's going
on the electrical activity
measure that report it in different ways
there's actually a lot of different ways
to report it's very rich
it has a tradition i follow very
traditional ways of working with it
since the 70s
traditional equipment all of that and
mind is the stuff that we think about
like cognitive functions
so it's and and if we think of something
even like you you're given a list and
you have to sort the list in
alphabetical order that's something a
computer can do
it's something a human being can do uh
i've even seen elephants do this
in bali so you know it's a
mind is about the information processing
and it's not just the brain and then
psyche is what jung talked about and
that's
you know when although people are very
excited about cognitive functions
it is really that developmental piece
that jung talked about the confrontation
with the shadow
one-sidedness and the tension of
opposites the transcendent function
um talked about other functions besides
the mental functions
and and that's something that includes
environment so it's not just my brain
it's my mind all the things i'm thinking
about in my environment with you
and you with me and and all of that and
everyone listening
so psyche is this really expansive thing
and to try and bring
sort of the lower level and the upper
level together
it's not going to be one-to-one
correlation you know because i
our brain is our toolbox or our
orchestra
and we developed the tools this is what
the data suggests that meet our
practical needs
like career needs cultural needs um
we call them demands uh and it also
meets our psychological needs hopefully
you know we find a nice balance with
those so that's what i've been doing is
collecting data i've been really pushed
uh because i yeah in the first few years
i worked and did this at ucla but for
the most part i've been pushed to
actually make people practical reports
that they can use um and to communicate
that in english
uh or in some cases in french um
and yeah because the french you know
they they want their own translations
for things
and um a google translate's great for
french by the way even the french people
said it was great
um which i'm shocked but of course it's
because french people worked on it
so it's uh it has really been wonderful
to help people discover
um how their brain works and sometimes
it's not in the ways they expected
uh if they come in wondering like am i
this
type like am i enfp or enfj
weirdly the reason they're having the
confusion in real life
is because their brain also has some
splits in terms of skills
that they've had to learn maybe for
their job or
the culture they were you know if you
raised in india and you go to very
traditional indian school system
you're going to have that judging
preference like pounded into you
and that's different than in america
where it's more like what is your
learning style
so it's um there there's it's really
been an adventure and to look at couples
and people as they do meditation
and all of these things so it's i could
go on but
you know i think that really lays out
the big picture
yeah that's amazing first of all i love
the fact that you like
i think everyone kind of looks at the
neuroscience of personality as like okay
this is what we know for sure but what i
really love is that you take ns9 today
this isn't surprising but you take
really holistic approach to this and you
look at it it's like
this is what we know about how the
brain's operating on kind of like a
hardware level but you really
have to factor in like how these people
are raised what culture they're growing
up in what different influences are
coming in to like shape the psyche
which i think is something that the type
world doesn't always naturally gravitate
towards looking at like we want kind of
like this prescriptive idea of our type
and we want someone to tell us
you're this type so you're going to do
things this way and this is what career
you should go for and
it's really not that simple so okay
here's a question
if you learn these things early in life
let's say something that's related to a
function that you don't
prefer so for example i was raised in a
family of a lot of
uh tj types so it's like i had to call
on te
a lot more in my younger years than
maybe the average enfp did
does that make me um does that make
using it later in life
easier for me or is it just kind of like
okay i know my way around
more but i don't necessarily have an
easier time
calling on it uh you know there there's
a little bit of both
i would say one is that if you need to
work with people or do activities that
involve
that non-preferred function you're gonna
be like oh i know how to join in on that
you know with tj parents it's like yeah
you know i've
i i know how to work with these people i
know how to do this
but you know i can say um i
i living on the beach in the caribbean
for three years starting school there
being in a very esfp culture because
that's what barbados was
uh is um that that
did not somehow make me any better at
doing
things that esfps as adults can do yeah
i know how to have fun if it's on
vacation
if it's like some physical activity
within those
and i'm very happy i have those because
i have some outlets and i meet intjs who
are raised in like
a very you know like intuiting or
thinking household without the sensing
and then they can be pretty unbalanced
because what matters almost in our
day-to-day life
like if you take your 24 hours and ask
how am i spending those hours
are you spending any hours so are you
leaving room
for your non-preferred functions to have
some room to play
some space to come out and that's what i
mean it's like you're creating this
channel the space
we're sure you know i i could learn
maybe surfing as an adult and i know how
i would do it as an intj i'm going to
approach it as a
well i'm gonna task myself up if i'm not
good at it
and i'm gonna set like standards for
like how better i'm getting and whatever
it is
but i don't need to do any of that like
i already know how
so is much easier and i'd be just like
you know what then that actually is play
time
right for real extroverted sensing play
time
and and so it really is about i would
say it's like the stuff that you take
if it matches your from your background
its culture or your family if it matches
your preferences
you got a nice boost that validated you
and if it didn't match then you've got a
boost in the things that are not you
and either way you're going to go on in
life you just have a different material
to work with as you grow
but i believe it's all about having uh
growth mindset and and because it's a
type is about development really that's
its superpower
and um finding ways to say yes you know
you can you you can do tj stuff for fun
and i know enfps who will clean their
house
to relieve stress and it was enjoyable
no i relate to that and i'm curious does
that how much can we expect that
to change or kind of naturally develop
as we age is that something that
is going to happen whether we
consciously work on it or not or
do you believe that the development of
those inferior functions comes more so
from conscious effort
um jung said it was both and
he said that there's a push that comes
up naturally from
the unconscious when we fail to make
room
for uh the non the non-preferences
yeah and what he meant by that is it's
not just in the head
remember kasaiki is about other people
in the environment and all of that
so an enfp who completely neglects the
stj stuff like finances for example
will eventually be bitten in the butt by
lack of money the tax man all of these
things these not in their head
these are like actual practical things
in real life it would be like that
wake-up call and that's jung said the
unconscious exists everywhere
not just in here and so the stuff comes
up
and we may for a while try and suppress
it
you know or like take care of it in a
little corner and even if we take care
of it a little way that's usually like
pretty good it's like do that
that's okay like do that but if you try
and suppress it this is where all of his
patients came to him they have neuroses
and with enfps it's often psychosomatics
yeah kind of stuff um and that
psychosomatic stuff is an indicator
that stuff is in the unconscious which
could be out in the world or inside you
wherever it is that needs to be given
breathing room
and that's where things like yoga
meditation
um go in and take a workshop
that's like working on the shadow
processes whatever it is
allow those give yourself a day off
where you're doing something that's like
out of the norm like a craft
activity or something and something's
going to come out of that
and then jung said it is the job of the
ego the conscious self to go to work
and actually like pull that out and say
hey like how am i going to develop this
and he said it's a marriage between the
unconscious doing the lifting at the
beginning
and then the ego hopefully and this is
where you come in
because he said it's not enough to say
oh the ego can just deal with he's like
the person needs sufficient resources
and knowledge to know how
and for him people came to him and he's
like i'm the therapist i'm going to show
them how but
you as a coach like you're you're
essentially saying here's the blueprint
for how you can take this material
and from being like a source of worry or
something you're going to push away
and actually manifest that in your life
in a healthy way
yeah one thing i love that you you said
to me previously which i
really really agree with and align with
is um a lot of people kind of take this
approach to developing their inferior
functions that are like okay if i want
more
s.i in my life i have to go like live
like you know an ice tj or an icfj would
live and kind of copy
people who are using that in a higher
stacking way
um but you said in the past like i
really you really
feel like the route to developing those
functions is through the more conscious
functions so like
si developing through the heavy robust
use of
ne uh t e developing through the robust
and
healthy use of fi can you speak a little
bit to that
yeah absolutely so young observed that
that we really can only develop the
other functions in the context of our
dominant function
so if our dominant function is actually
undeveloped or it is sort of just capped
in a certain way that's actually not
room it's like
saying i want to have all these
different things on my buffet plate but
my plate is only this big
yeah and your dominant function is your
main entree plate
and it needs to be your main not the
entree the main so it needs to be bigger
and so it's actually really good for
every type
to consider how can i keep growing my
dominant function
and it's a back and forth so what allows
it to grow is by exposing it to
non-preferred stuff
but at the same time in order to
incorporate that stuff like
you need to also go back to what's
natural to you and make room for that
and an example would be this um
yeah you know a lot of enfps maybe dream
their fantasy
maybe it'd be so nice to have like a
house with a white picket fence and a
dog
or two dogs and like this traditional
suburban life or whatever it is i mean
it might happen but what really enfp is
about is not saying
i'm going to get anchored in all of
these it's not just tradition because
sjs are anchored in their sense
impressions from childhood so if
an sj was raised by hippies then they're
going to have hippy sense impressions
and that is
warm for enfp it's about creating a new
norm
and establishing a new tradition and we
see this so often like
novels that people read in um
like i remember reading jd salinger
stories in uh
in high school i'm pretty sure
jd salinger was an nf a lot of the
stories speak i remember my english
teacher furlough stories was definitely
enfp
like for sure um i didn't even know
typed them but i knew looking back like
she's
yeah and um and i loved the class
and and it was uh you know
these stories came they became new
american traditions
that like millions and millions of
people read and are exposed to
and the same with films that are shot uh
marketing campaigns that enfps create
like all of these things like jokes that
they tell
um through the use of extroverted
intuition to weave
stories in their lives i mean marriage
and love are a story
and that becomes a tradition after 20
years it's like
oh yeah like the the the romance and the
story i've created in my mind about us
is us it is the tradition yeah so it
could be very close to home
it could be very broad and cultural
wherever it is
you know they work they work hand in
hand together
and that's just one example but i
believe that that's like
one that's pretty easy to relate to um
and i i would say the other one if we're
going to talk about midlife if you want
to go into that
is like we can see more of a shift as
like a lot of different other ways those
come out
yeah i would love to talk about that
that's really interesting because
i love the idea of enfps needing to
create a new tradition because i think a
lot of us especially
um in our younger years feel this kind
of pull between the traditional
and the new and the novel and it's like
we kind of want
like there's this almost funny
stereotype of the any dom
just fantas like living this fascinating
life and then fantasizing secretly about
boring things
like i just i just have this fantasy
where i live at home and i like work a
nine-to-five job and everything's normal
and i go home and have the same day a
thousand days in a row
that's like our fantasy world then our
real world is often very
um like novel and exciting and kind of
chaotic by a lot of other people's
standards
so but i really love that you put it so
aptly we're trying to create a new
tradition like i think
more and more as the years go on for
enfps we start to realize like
this is the kind of variety and the kind
of excitement and the kind of novelty
that i really need to keep consistent in
my life it's like
we we kind of weave these threads of
consistency through all of this
seeming like perceived chaos and
disorder
um until we come to those traditions
that feel more authentic to us
than the ones that maybe we were raised
in and just before we
you know let you go um what are you
working on these days like where can we
find you where can we pursue more of
your information yeah yeah so it's um
i i'm at daarionardi.com although that's
not a very interesting
place it's a brochure but it doesn't
mean
yeah it's a brochure but but it you know
it has links to facebook and so i hate
facebook but i'm on it so it's uh
it serves its purpose um
uh yeah i is typical of intjs i'm
working on like a half dozen projects at
once
which causes me stress but somehow i
can't do it any other way
i'm just finishing up this book
on self coaching and i keep thinking i'm
almost done but the book
is now approaching like 340 pages
wow and and it is really
all about like every enfp is going to
have
60 pages on enfps
i mean either extroverted intuiting
introverted feeling
and how those where the self-coaching is
doesn't replace real coach it's it's you
know an add-on
but it's a resource and i really because
i have all these years of doing
basically what we're doing now
and i i'm like and even then by the way
i have to say like you bring out with
your questions so many more things than
would end up in the book
that that is just like you know because
there's so many things to talk about
like
and that's what covet 19 has given me is
free time
to write this like crazy big book and
that's
uh so that that's like been the big
project and then my other little
projects for those of you who followed
the neuroscience
um i now that i have well over 350
people
and lots of enfps i've really devoted a
lot of time to like analyzing that data
but you'll probably have to wait like
another six months to a year
before i have that out i do want to do
an update because 2011 is getting to be
like a decade away
right now yeah and um
it's time for an update and that's uh
that really goes like a whole level
deeper
and the flavors of every type and more
about really all about development and
all of that
and then the third piece is i personally
have become very involved
uh in leveling up my own introverted
intuiting my own dominant function
and i thought in my mid-30s that i
basically had maxed out on introverted
intuition and it's a great process
but it's time to like focus on other
processes
and and and that's true i mean that was
great but in order to keep growing
i needed to expand my plight of
introverted intuiting
and for me that's become really involved
with the shamanic practices
and um i was so impressed by infjs i
encountered
um one infj woman in particular who's
just like skills were so amazing
and and clearly like so much based and
introverted intuiting
and then i found the path that was right
for me which was a practice a little bit
more intj like
um but really i i just love like i have
a isfp student he calls himself my
student
uh i have people come every week and and
that's my way
of of using introverted intuition at a
level that i hadn't
even imagined uh six and a half years
ago
i was not even on the radar as like i
didn't even know it existed
a whole other level up so just again
everybody i think
everybody can know like whatever their
dominant function is
there's always a whole nother level up
intjs in particular
like i think people seek you out because
you do all of this like hard scientific
research right you've done that for so
long in the field of
psychological type but it's also cool
that you take
such an intuitive approach to it and
like i can see that it's lighting you up
to talk about like
shamanism and all these different
theories that you're learning that are a
lot more really like
working with people one-on-one to deal
with these very very
not black and white issues um so it's
just so cool
to to see that like although you take
the scientific approach
to your work your exploration of life
runs so much more deeply than that
and i just think that's what makes you
such a wonderful contribution to the
field of typology so just on behalf of
everyone thank you so much for all the
work that you do and continue to do
um because i just think like it's so
important and so meaningful and
if you guys are not already out there
consuming all of dario nardi's work
you need to do it right like turn off
this lecture and go do it right now
because it's such great information um
and it's just
comes from such a cool holistic approach
that i just think is so needed
it's just been a pleasure to talk to you
and learn from you and learn more about
not only my own mind but like how all
these different minds are wired and how
we can kind of work together with that
um and i i think that all the enfps
watching this are just going to feel
very very um grateful and inspired
afterwards
um so hopefully this will not be their
last stop on the journey of engaging
with your work
beautiful thank you so much for having
me and it was a pleasure the whole time
it was uh
lots of fun hey so you just watched a
video that i recorded with dario nardi
in the summer of 2020 and now it's
october 2020
and i am posting the interview now for a
couple of reasons one so the entire
interview has actually been up um
on my enfp soul boot camp course over
the summer so the entire interview is
about two hours long somewhere around
there
and we break it up and do a couple
different interviews on a couple
different topics
but as i was rewatching it in the fall i
was like wow this feels so relevant
right now because
dario just released the book that he was
talking about at the end of this video
the magic diamond eight young's eight
paths for self coaching
um and i just finished reading it and i
was thinking that so much of what he
goes over in this book was kind of
mirrored in the interview so it'd be
really cool to give you guys
a bit of info about what it's about um a
question that i get a lot
is how do i work on developing my
inferior functions whether that's shadow
functions or
like if you're an enfp s-i-n-t-e if
you're in istj
and e and fi whatever it is for you
figuring out how to work with our
inferior functions or our shadow
functions so those that we don't prefer
in our dominant stacking
is a really hard thing to actually
figure out in the type world a lot of
people
give a lot of advice on how to recognize
and how to understand the role of our
inferior or shadow functions
but i haven't yet seen a really thorough
explanation of how to work with them
and that's something that dario does
really well in this book so i just
finished reading my sections
so i read the section on extroverted
intuition and a section on introverted
feelings since those are my two
top preferred functions and what's
really cool about this is that he goes
into detail
on how to work on your shadow functions
as the type that you are
so it's not like okay how do you work on
fi for
any type if it's in your shadow stacking
it's like as an enfp
how do you work on ti or as in estj
how would you work on fe so he looks at
where
your functions already fall and then how
you can work on your shadow functions in
relation to your dominant or more
preferred functions
to avoid what young calls one-sidedness
which he goes over
a little bit in this interview but at
length in the book um so yeah this book
is a really good tool for
learning how your shadow functions show
up for you and how you can integrate
them in a way that's realistic and
that's a question that i get all the
time
and everyone who's asked me this knows
that my answer to how to work with your
shadow functions or your lesser
preferred functions
is figure out how you can get them to
serve your more preferred functions
because you can't develop like te in a
vacuum you have to look at where is that
function falling for me in my stacking
and how can i use it to support
something higher up so that i'm growing
it in a way that's authentic
sustainable and ecological in my life
and it's not just me
ignoring what i'm naturally good at and
naturally inclined to do
for a while while i kind of hyper focus
on something and then drop because it's
not realistic
so if you're looking for a tool um a
self-coaching manual
for learning how your inferior and
shadow functions
can show up in support of your more
preferred functions this book is a great
way to start
um i wasn't asked to do this by any
means i just
finished reading this and was like hey
this could be some good information for
people
uh so i definitely recommend going to
either dario's website or going to
i got this off amazon and picking up
this book if you're interested in it i'm
also doing a three-part workshop with
dario nardian personality hacker
virtually starting tomorrow uh on the
shadow function process and
on dario's approach to it so i'll let
you guys know how that goes
but i'm really excited for it and i hope
that you enjoyed this interview as much
as i enjoyed doing it
