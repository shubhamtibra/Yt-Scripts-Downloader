hey guys i am here today with i guess
i'm very excited to have so this is
denzel mensah who you probably already
know from youtube and if you don't you
should
absolutely go look at the description
and follow him immediately
because he has awesome type content he
posts super regularly
um he's got really really great insights
not just about typology but just about
life in general
um and denzel and i used to run a weekly
live stream so we used to get together
and talk about type once a week and it's
been
at least like a year a year or two since
we've done that so i am
really really excited that you're here
and we're having another chat so thanks
so much for being here
yeah thanks for having me for like i i
missed you a lot
so i know even though this isn't really
like live right now like this is just
fun to be able to have you
back on my computer screen and i'm
really excited for the conversation that
we're about to have
likewise so denzel is an enfj
and i'm an enfp and we're going to be
chatting about what the differences
between those two types are
um because there is a decent amount of
confusion between them like i think i
typed as an enfj the first time that i
took a personality test and i've met
enfjs who've typed as enfps
and there's a lot of superficial
difference or similarities between those
two types
um so we're going to go over like what
those are and then what the differences
are and then what the deep
similarities and differences are because
when you get into cognitive functions
and looking at what's actually going on
internally for both types
it's very different even though like the
output might look very similar
um so we were chatting before the live
stream started i guess not
oh my god i have to get out of the habit
of saying live stream when on
we're chatting before we started
recording um
about some of the similarities between
our types and there are
a lot of them like i really feel like if
you meet an enfp or an enfj it can be
hard to tell from the get-go
unless you're really well-versed in
functions um what's up
like what's operating internally for
those people and
um how to type them so i think we could
just start with some of the similarities
um so one that we were immediately
talking about was
wanting to be group affiliated and
having
like just a very very big appetite for
social interaction and that's also
because both of us are social doms in
the enneagram so that might change a
little bit between
different types but i think you'll very
often see enfps and
fjs at the center of like intentional
communities that they've sought out
and that they want to be surrounded by
and intentionally surrounding themselves
with a lot of different people
and wanting to hear a lot of different
perspectives and insights from people
and wanting to get to know a lot of
people well
um all the ef types you'll see this with
but definitely you'll see it with enfp
and enfj especially if they're
healthy and and kind of in a good place
where they've
gone to lengths to create that for
themselves right right
yeah like we i see us especially
um as the catalyst a lot of times for
these kinds of
um communities just like you said like
being like in the center and everything
like
usually finding the topics for these
communities to
kind of like you know the enfp is known
as like the champion
and so i see like enfps a lot of times
like
kind of finding that cause for a lot of
people to kind of center around but then
i think that enfjs also have a tendency
to do that as well
even though it might be coming from a
different place and it's even
interesting to see how like
both of them get the same results but
then you know
just like a different mind wiring like
you said so it takes like
you have to really look at the functions
to see like oh we both look the same on
the outside for this reason but then
um from the inside you're operating more
from a place like this and this is how
you operated that whereas like for an
enfp
you're operating it this way but both
being like idealists
and kind of like people focused or
community focused in a way
ics is like catalyst and that's type of
sense
yeah i really like that actually because
it's not just about being a part of the
communities it's wanting them to have
i think the enfj wants them to have
direction the enfp
is a little bit more like let's just
gather people around this cause and let
them kind of live out whatever feeling
or whatever
thoughts they're going to have about it
the enf is a little more
directed in that they'll kind of i'm
like already hopping into the
differences
but um they'll be thinking a lot about
like how is this going in what direction
is it moving in
in what direction are different people
moving in in relation to each other and
themselves and the group
the enfp i think is a little bit more um
like i don't think a ton about the
direction of the communities
i just think about how is everyone
feeling like is everyone happy
um how can we create like like how can
we take this to the next level
in a bunch of different ways and it's
fun to explore all those different ways
um whereas i think the enfj is a little
bit more
intentionally focused on like the
long-term outcome
of anything they're a part of yeah i
would definitely agree with that
um i feel like kind of like what you
said you know like you're
thinking about a lot of how is everybody
feeling which you know of course is an
enfj
like that's also like what's the top of
our radar like okay how does
everybody feel about this you know
harmony and everything um
but then also at the same time it's like
uh
i think for us it's it's kind of like
it's almost as a
it's a unity that we're looking for um
within the group
and then when we find that unifying
point i believe
then it's kind of like now we want to
continue to capitalize
on that unifying point and i feel like
i don't know if you know would you say
that enfps often like would do the same
thing
is that what you're also describing um
because then when you said
intentionality like that's kind of like
what came to
mind it's like okay this is the like you
said the direction or the vision that i
have
so now i'm unifying everybody around
this
vision and we all you know how do we
feel about this vision you know if you
aren't if you don't like the vision then
well uh
i don't want you around here you know
but then if you are like for the vision
then you know that way we can all carry
this together
and move forward um as a community as a
group
and try to you know better ourselves
throughout that
so that it's like having this one vision
this one cause and then
allowing um opportunities from like you
know down the road like anything that
will
plunge us closer to that vision as a p
try to take advantage of those
opportunities um but the enfj i would
say is
always tapping into like make sure like
is everybody still on board
with this vision um and tweaking the
vision
if necessary being open to like other
people's like strengths and ideas
um to further help us get toward that
vision
and i think the funny thing also is that
once we have that vision and once we
start getting closer to that vision
um we already have another vision
so i think about like martin luther king
jr which i know like a lot of people
have been
like cozy infj enfj i like really
studied his life and i'm i'm firmly
believe that he's an enfj
um but one of the things i thought that
was like really interesting about him
was that you know everyone knows him for
like i have a dream and he had that
vision
that we are now living today you know
racism of course is not
dead but all of us are like you know
little black boys and little black girls
are you know like playing together and
like going to school together and
stuff like that and it's way better than
when he was alive
but now we have another vision you know
like
so i think that enfj is a lot of times
like
especially those who often say like oh
fe fedoms like they just conform
to social norms one thing that i've
always liked saw
was that if anything we're the ones who
are often creating them
and trying to punish them forward um and
so
we're the social norms exist a lot of
times because of us
and that's why it seems like we're
conforming to them but then
as soon as we reach that social norm
ideal
we already have another advanced social
norm that we're trying to work toward
and
we're never going to reach that ideal
carrot
like it's the donkey that's chasing
after the carrot for
ever does that make sense i have so many
thoughts on what you just said that to
the point where i'm already like i'm
gonna have to cut down my own
response to this um first of all i
totally agree with what you were saying
about
uh enfj's being very often at the center
of like social changes and
having this incredibly visionary
approach and
um i think it really is that auxiliary
ni it's underestimated in a lot of tight
profiles like both
entj and enfj a lot for their dominant
function like we talk about entjs and
how productive they are we talk about
enfjs and how
warm and people oriented and loving
there but we really leave
out of the type descriptions that
auxiliary and i which is
so forward-thinking and so influential
like i would if i were to give a single
word for enfj it would probably be
influence
like the ability to see something
that that needs to be done in the future
or a direction that people need to move
and be able to get other people on board
with that vision which is
exactly what you were saying um and
that's a really really
under discussed quality of enfjs and it
just reminded me of a conversation i was
having yesterday this is a bit of a
tangent but
um my partner and i were talking about
uh estjs and entjs in the wellness space
because there's a lot of both of those
types in the kind of like morning
routine productivity space
um which her and i both work in um
myself part-time her full-time but um
we're talking about like how you spot
the difference and it's like
estjs tend to be they internalize a lot
of those things like they kind of
internalize all the best ways to be
productive and to set routines and then
they'll live them out and kind of
um perpetuate them but entjs are the
ones who go in and figure it out in the
first place like they're the ones who do
all the research and like
figure out okay this is the most optimal
way to start your day and they're
they're like
setting the precedent and then those
with si come in and they want to learn
the system to death
and and optimize it and use it as best
as possible but we don't give enough
credit to the fact that auxiliary ni
because ni is a little bit more
conscious for them than it even is for
people who use it as a dominant function
um who are kind of like swimming in it
so it's it's a little bit
less observable having auxiliary ni
allows you to be
very clear-headed i think about your
visions because you're
enough removed from them that you're
kind of looking looking at them and can
analyze them
the same way enfps can analyze their
introverted feeling wow yeah
so it's like yeah that's just something
we don't give anywhere near enough
credit
like nowhere in the ballpark of the
proper amount of credit to enfjs
i fully agree with that like every time
i'm seeing like enfj profiles and stuff
like that
it i i love the idea that you know we
get known for like you know our warmth
and our
um you know like how friendly or
whatever that we are
but yeah i think that the ni is like
very very heavily like
just diluted um and it just comes down
to like small crumbs like oh and you
know sometimes maybe they'll say like
mantras and
you know have like a five-day plan or
five-year plan or something but
let's just focus on that that warmth and
that kindness and then
when you look at maybe like with other
types then you'll see like a lot of like
you know like the infjs not only known
for their
ni but they're also very heavily known
for like look at how great they are with
people and
read this and it's like so
where's the same kind of you know
treatment for the
dominant auxiliary uh there so i'm glad
that you noticed that too because i
guess like sometimes it's like
is it just because i'm an enfj that i'm
saying like well we're being you know
whatever like thrown to the side in this
way or you know or is everybody else
also seeing this problem
but but yeah with everything you said no
it's true because even with the enfp
profile i feel like we are
overrepresented for our fi
and underrepresented for our ne like
we're talked a lot like people talk a
lot about enfps and how they're like
you know so emotional and so emotionally
intelligent maybe or so
um like kind of always living a new like
adventurous emotional experience
but i'm like that's a lot less of our
experience of life than our
extroverted intuition is and our i like
our exploration of ideas and
and the way that we think but we're over
um stereotyped on our fi
and you're under stereotyped on your ni
which makes me just think maybe people
don't understand n functions enough to
create problem stereotypes
that really could be a big thing right
there um yeah
yeah so i'm glad that we'll be able to
clarify that a little bit more in this
video
yeah but okay so third thing that your
original
thoughts made me think of was when you
were talking about that
um that like ni vision versus
what it looks like for enfps in a
community i had this
like i was picturing like two ships
leaving a harbor
and the efj ship is like this beautiful
elegant ship that everyone like
everyone gets on board and there's like
you know all of this like wonderful
stuff happening where everyone gets
together and decides like okay we're
steering the ship in this direction
and the efp ship it's like a like a
pirate ship
where it's like you just get on board
and it's like okay we're going in search
of treasure
don't really we're like we have some
ideas of where the treasure is and we're
just gonna kind of go look
but if something more interesting
happens along the way we're going to
reevaluate constantly whereas like
i just see the enfj ship is like just
steering so like there's someone like at
the front of the ship with their compass
always like moving in a certain
direction and checking in
to make sure like this still works and
the enfp ship is kind of like okay we
have
five different places that sound cool
like
let's let's go explore as many of them
as we can and then
if we have a better idea along the way
we're gonna we're gonna go with that and
then once we get to the first treasure
site
we're gonna be like okay what's what now
what are we working with and let's set
the next route but it's not as directed
um and i really think that's the
difference that's one of the main
differences in the enfj versus inf
or sorry enfj versus enfp psyche it's
just that
enfjs have a lot of um purpose direction
vision it's not the enfps don't but we
are a lot
less directed in our vision like we like
to keep our options open it's
fun for us to constantly think where
could we go next
so if we felt like we were on a ship
that was sailing in a certain direction
no matter how exciting that direction is
we're gonna start getting sad along the
way
when we're like oh i just thought of
this other place we could sail the ship
but we can't go there
um because we don't like we don't have
as much finesse i guess for lack of a
better term
in terms of our vision so i think for
enfjs and correct me if i'm wrong
it's exciting to think and like
constantly reassess and reevaluate and
add to how you're going to optimize this
vision
and that's the fun part so like for you
possibilities and potential exists
within that
but for us it's kind of like the big
overarching
vision it's is what's fun so if we're
expected to kind of narrow and narrow
and narrow our focus and figure out more
and more and more about what makes one
thing
really exciting um that's going to drain
us very quickly because we just want to
think of like
five different visions and then we might
end up at one we might end up at five it
doesn't really matter
the fun part is like deciding okay we're
gonna steer the ship in a different
direction all of a sudden
uh and that's that's
i think a big difference and we'll be
having fun on the ship like it's party
boat but it's not
it's not um as cohesive by any means
yeah i definitely pictured everything
like i literally pictured the
enfj ship and everybody on it and stuff
like that and then
and then the camera pans over to the
pirate ship with the e
and honestly like honestly speaking it
it further shows how
which i think is one of the beauties of
type because a lot of people i feel like
they get this twisted like
literally no type is better than the
other type
um and that's not just with enfp or enfj
black for all types like they're just
different so that that pirate ship is
just different but like you know it
depends on what your flavor is like
you want to be on the one that's like
you know more
uh oh we have like kind of like one
vision and we're going toward this and
then for us
um i think which is a difference like
where the j and the p
uh could get mixed up a little bit is
that
we have a little bit of leniency toward
the enfp where it's like
we have this destination that we want to
arrive at
and on our way to that destination with
that compass um
the fun of it i guess is that we can
enjoy other things that may pop up along
the way
but only if those things can like
kind of like get us right back to that
same vision
point um so it's like okay you know like
one of the things i'll always assess
is like okay if we explore that or if we
explore that
will it bring us any closer to the
actual vision that we have
whereas if i'm understanding you
correctly like the enfp is like
we have like five different you know
yeah like mission
like places like destinations and so
if something pops up it's like oh i
really want to explore that like well
will it get you to the place that you
want to get to
um it'll probably get me closer to one
of the five yeah
or maybe there's a sixth one that i
didn't even list down and
yeah exactly yeah and it's almost more
exciting to discover like oh there was a
sixth route
cool yeah that's the newest one so
that's very exciting like
and i think for me as an enfj that would
be like stressful
and so i think that's also like one of
the things where it's like
um we our fun
not fun i don't use the word fun but
kind of fun like
our segways or uh tangents
are always somehow being wrapped back
around
like i find that even with like
conversations like i can
bring up something and then it'll seem
like we just went totally off course
and then i'll wrap it back around to
where what we were talking about
and then people were like oh yeah we
were talking about
that yeah but it seemed like we were
like so long-winded and we went like
a completely different direction um and
sometimes people think that like the
enfj is going
totally off track but in actuality in my
opinion i've seen it's like no
no just continue to follow me trust me
it's
you're gonna see how this actually helps
us get even closer to what we were
what we were uh going for from the
beginning
so i think that that's like a really big
thing um when it comes like enfjs
versus like how the enfp may uh view
that vision for a community
or this pirate ship versus the uh
cruise ship i guess i don't know even if
even just in
conversation like i think that that's
something that enfj naturally does that
desire to kind of wrap everything
together whereas the enfp
has to be we can do it but it's a
learned skill like
i will never accidentally start a
conversation
that uh is very cohesive like i can like
even
before we started this live stream right
i was like okay there's three things i
really want to try to hit
but i have to try to do that or else it
won't happen i will just go off on a
whole bunch of different tangents and it
might accidentally connect back because
we do have that extroverted intuition
that's always connecting something to
something else
so i get really excited when i start
talking about something and then i start
talking about something else and then
my brain puts them together and i have
all these realizations
that feels very exciting but it's not
something i intentionally orchestrate
it's just
it might happen accidentally it might
happen uh because i'm being intentional
about wrapping something together
but it will never be what my mind does
on autopilot which i think is
more so how it works for the enfj like
you guys on autopilot think about how
everything kind of fits into this big
picture that is
um it's like i like to think of the
difference
between the way that enfjs and or and i
and any really look at the big picture
as like
ni's kind of like in space looking at
earth or like looking at like the box
you know when we talk about being
outside the box
they're looking at all the how all the
pieces fit together within it
and it's like is kind of out in space
turned away from the box
or like the earth or whatever looking at
the possibilities in space so it's like
we're always going outward
like we're going more and more and more
like where can we push a boundary and
and find out something new versus ni
is like where can we find order within
what we already
can observe and know like they want this
kind of
not detailed necessarily but like
cohesive big picture whereas the any
big picture doesn't have to be cohesive
at all that's not that it's fun when it
is but it's not
a necessity that it is like there can be
a lot of mysteries that are still
unsolved and that's fun
yeah that makes sense um one of the
questions actually that i wanted to ask
you
uh so i know for me as an enfj my
uh vision um comes from
my ni like okay this is the kind of
vision that i have and it's
shaped from the people so it's like the
people around me
can kind of shape that vision because if
this is not what
the people want or sometimes it is what
the people want but it's not what they
need and i think that's another big
thing
that people need to know about enfj is
like at least healthy ones
we're not just all about like this is
what the people want it's like
well i know that you want this but what
you actually need is this which could
seem like a god complex of some sort but
that really is like our superpower
like we are tapped into thinking
all day every day about these
relationships and these dynamics and
like what people need
um and in relationships and stuff like
that and so
our my my vision comes from that and i
of thinking about like okay so what
what is uh what what do i want
not only for you know the people but me
included with the people what would be
like best
for them um and if what
is necessary for the people around me uh
what it what is needed for the people
around me if that changes
then my ni vision kind of like changes
to that too so it's influenced by
my fe for you as an enfp would you say
that your visions come from your fi
or okay i think like my kind of purpose
and passion
comes from fi it's like which direction
i want to go in is usually in any
kind of exploration like i'm like oh
this would like an example i'll use is
like the
um enfp of peaceful boot camp programs
that i started in the past year it's
like
right that was born of an any excitement
like i was like oh it would be really
fun to have a place where
you know enfps and infps could come and
learn all of these kind of wellness
skills that are generally taught by tjs
and figure out how to integrate them in
their lives in a way that worked and i
had a million ideas about how to do that
but then what my fi really fixated on
was like what if we could bring
people together and give them a place
where they felt very accepted and very
um nurtured and very much like oh it's
okay to kind of breathe and be who i am
and that's how i decided on like the
method so that for a while they were
um there was like a lot of group
activity now just
because um of various reasons it's like
we're doing a self-study
program and seeing how that goes but um
what my fi wanted was like like i often
think about what i would want so it
often comes not from kind of
surveying the public and be like what do
you guys want i will do that like i'll
do market research and stuff in my work
but
um in general i think the most fi kind
of
saying that gets tossed out there a lot
when it comes to this stuff is
like you know be the person you wish
you'd had when you were younger like
that i think is a very
fi influenced saying and i think it
informs a lot of the work i do or a lot
of the choices i make because i think
about like oh
what have i needed and lacked in my life
and then you
you generally assume that's to some
extent universalizable like
it's not necessarily but if i perceive
this lack of something in the world
whether it's like you know emotionally
or tangibly or whatever
and then i go and create it i'm just
gonna kind of assume other people also
needed that
and um it's not always the case
but i think that a lot of people who use
fi in either the dominant or auxiliary
position or even tertiary
um really operate under that stance like
think about what i need and where i'm
feeling emotionally
um unfulfilled or whatever it is
and then try to find people who will
also relate to that so it's kind of like
fi is kind of like this fountain where
it's like okay i'm gonna make the
fountain bigger and bigger and then if
other people want to come play in the
fountain that's cool that's awesome but
if not i'm just going to be over here
being a fountain
yeah i think effie sorry yeah yeah i was
just going to say the fe like
transitioning back to what you're saying
um is more about first checking the
temperature and then figuring out like
what
people need yeah yeah that makes total
sense um
and you know a common trope uh within
the
myers-briggs community is always like oh
fi
is selfish and thankfully i feel like
we've been tweaking it
now and it's like to be more specific uh
i would say that fi is
self-centered um which people would
probably like oh what's the difference
like well
self-centered means like kind of like
that whole thing like you have to like
you know put the mask on yourself before
you can like you know the oxygen mask on
yourself before you like put on somebody
else
and i see like fi as like the
um self-healing and being self-nurturing
in some way
and in in in learning how to do that for
yourself you then also know how to you
also learn how to do it for other people
um and so uh when i think of you know
like what you just said like
that makes total sense because fi users
um from my experience
they've gotten really really good at
being able to understand their own like
you know inner feelings and
morals and like what they want like you
said like you know and then
being able to understand other people's
feelings as well
from that sense like i know that um joel
mark witt and antonia dodge from
personality hacker
they often speak about fi as kind of
like a tuning fork
where it's like okay they have spent so
much time
like looking into their own feelings and
you know
ideals and whatever um and understanding
that on a very nuanced level
that now when they meet somebody else
then
they kind of like try to match it like
they look within themselves and
like match like okay this is the closest
feeling to what that person might be
feeling
um whereas i think for fe i definitely
don't do that i did not have that kind
of nuance like
that rich kind of nuance like you guys
do um
and so our thing at least what it's been
like for me is like i
i like legitimately feel what that
person is feeling
and kind of use that but then once i'm
like kind of like away from it
then it's kind of like i'm not really
like feeling that
as heavily and so therefore it's like oh
i don't
i'm not really dwelling with what you
know they felt unless i'm just like
thinking about it
or something but i can't feel it as
heavily because
i'm i'm no longer in that presence does
that make sense what i'm saying
yes and i think that is the single
biggest
difference between enfjs and enfps that
people will notice
very quickly and i also want to quickly
make the caveat you could be neither of
these types if you're
here because you're not sure if you're
an enfp or an enfj
i find very often there are other types
like something i like to kind of
reference
when i'm helping people figure out type
is like if you're really stuck between a
and b sometimes it's because the answer
is c
like it might it's very often because
neither of those things are correct
which is why neither feel like they fit
like a glove
so you might want to look at other types
look at the other e f types if you
if you feel very sure of like um
that that you one of these kind of
archetypes because there's a lot of
similarities also between esfjs and
esfps within the enfj enfp
um conundrum but i think one thing that
most people will relate to very quickly
or that it's very simple to
self-reference on is how you're
processing and experiencing your own
emotions
so i think when i talk to um
let's say enfps who think that they're
enfjs
what normally gets them is when i
explain like
when when an enfj explains how they
experience emotions it's so different
like for enfps we are so
self-referencing so
at pretty much every point in time i
know exactly how i feel
and if i don't know exactly how i feel i
know that if i slowed down and just
gave myself some alone time to process
it i would know exactly how i feel so
i'm very very self-referencing in
relation to my emotional experience
it almost feels like like the metaphor i
kind of accidentally always have for it
in my mind is like oh when do i need to
metabolize something so it's like i'll
be out in the world doing things and
gathering
experiences and forming relationships
and
it it starts to feel almost like heavy
in my like emotional stomach if you will
if i haven't spent a lot of time alone
thinking through like what do these
experiences
mean to me how do i feel about um these
new relationships i'm forming how does
it
maybe fit in with the rest of my life or
um just generally stop and reflect about
it i start
feeling like almost like if your stomach
isn't processing your food properly it
would start feeling heavy
it starts feeling like that for me
emotionally like oh i need to go be
alone and think about
my feelings or else it feels like heavy
in my in my emotional stomach
um and then once i've taken time whether
it's like going for a really long walk
and listening to music
or journaling or i'm not a big journaler
but i know a lot of fi people are
um so that might be it for you or just
literally like
taking a day sitting around sometimes
i'll like write a blog post
i'll chat with some friends i'll like
kind of be
turning over in my mind how i'm feeling
until i reach like yeah now i kind of
understand it very clearly
but it takes a lot of um alone time and
a loan processing for me to do that
versus i feel like for enfjs and correct
me if i'm wrong
what helps you understand your feelings
is actually like speaking about them to
other people and being in the presence
of other people
so that you can kind of understand like
how that relates back to you but i would
love to hear more about how you
experience like emotional processing
yeah yeah i think that that's definitely
it
like you know okay let me share this
with another person
in a way so that that way um it's almost
like
it's like the trope where it's like
enfjs are so good at giving other people
um good advice for their feelings or
whatever but then they suck at it for
themselves
and i've noticed this a lot like i've
gotten a lot better at it now
but i literally had to like start
throwing myself in a way
to like okay what would denzel tell
denzel
i like legitimately like have to do that
like hey if i
if somebody literally came to me with
this problem
and or they're not feeling this way like
how would you
advise that person right and
that has helped a lot but it doesn't
help nearly as much as like being able
to actually do it with somebody else
where
a lot of times i do just have to go to
somebody else and
start telling them like hey this is
what's going on or whatever whatever
start you know saying it out loud and
then having like a little bit of back
and forth
so that i can be like oh okay yeah that
makes sense you know like
jamila isfp my wife
she's great at that with me like just
asking hmm and so what do this and what
about this what about that
i would have never thought about that
question for myself i don't know like
that
i think maybe this or this boom boom
and then she will kind of like just not
even kind of like fully just make sense
of how i'm feeling about something um
but yeah that's really interesting
because i don't think that i really get
that kind
of like emotional indigestion um
however uh i think that my equivalent
could be which makes sense you know
because the polarity of fe is ti
it's what do i think about something and
i'm like
constantly like you know recalibrating
and
you know thinking like okay wait a
minute this is my
you know personal uh thoughts on this
and this is like the consistency
of these logical data points or whatever
like what i believe about this
whatever the topic might be um but this
person
thinks this this is where it you know
doesn't like you know where it
contradicts so which one of these are
right
okay well how will i figure out if
that's right or if that's wrong like
i can't just go talk to somebody else
about it because they might bring
something else so i have to like look at
this and
so i'm literally just always thinking
about that kind of thing and it's like
okay and now from knowing this
information
how will this then help the community
that i'm now involved in because
in order to be able to help the
community i have to have clean
information for the community i have to
you know make sure that whatever i'm
telling them
is accurate um or at least the best of
my ability
accurate because if i'm giving false
information and it's spreading
throughout the whole community so i have
to make sure i'm in my privacy and
thinking like okay
so this is right this is wrong this
seems like it's right at least for right
now until somebody presents something
otherwise
um so this is probably safe to tell the
community and we should probably hold
this and
tinker it just a little bit more and i
feel like that's how most of my
time is spent um especially like when
i'm alone
yeah and okay there's again so many
interesting points in that because one
you talk about um
not wanting to release information into
the community until you're sure that
it's like you use the word
uncontaminated which is exactly
how i think fi looks at um sharing its
feelings
so it's like something that always
surprises me when i'm around fe doms is
like i'll meet them and they'll just
start telling me how they're feeling and
i'm like whoa
i wouldn't know you for four years
before i told you like that much about
how i'm feeling but it's because you
you process feelings in a very literally
extroverted way
so it's the same way that um enfps use
our thinking function
like i will share what i think as soon
as i think it like i'll have a new
thought and i'll immediately go tweet it
and it's because te deals with what is
self-evident so i'm never too
worried that like people will come out
swinging because it's like oh either
there's
either if i've made a mistake it's v it
will be self-evident in my reasoning
itself so someone will just correct it
and we'll go on with our days
but most likely because i'm not thinking
in a system
the way that enfjs are um it's it's more
likely that what i'm tweeting is just
kind of an observation of reality so
it's like
there's not that much to argue with
usually like someone can have a
different
opinion about how something should be
done or whatever but like te is a very
self-evident
function like it just references what is
observable in the environment versus ti
looks at like how does everything fit
together
so it's it's easier to make an error
with ti which is why people with ti tend
to like take a lot more time to think
about how everything relates to each
other before they share a thought
um and that's how fi is about emotions
because it's like oh
i could be feeling a certain way but how
do i know i'm not just think i'm not
feeling that because of these 10 other
things so i have to fit it into this
kind of system of how i'm functioning
emotionally and then when i share it i
have to make sure i've
really deeply understood um like all the
different reasons why i'm feeling that
way and what it's related to and
i don't want to like like i don't want
to be
inaccurate about how i'm feeling when i
speak to someone so i won't
talk about my feelings on more than a
superficial level at least when they
first come up i'll kind of go like huh
and then i'll go home and process it and
then a while later i can share often in
retrospect oh during this experience i
felt like this
um but i rarely am emotionally
processing verbally
in real time however there is kind of an
enfp equivalent which is that we are
verbal processors in our extroverted
intuition so
yeah we will talk about like what we're
evaluating and analyzing about our lives
out loud
forever so it can feel sometimes like
we're talking about our emotions but
when we look
at it we're really not like last week i
had a decision to make like i had
basically some travel planned and i was
feeling weird about
like the fact that um it's a pandemic
and i was like oh i kind of
like i planned it a long time ago right
and i was like oh it'll things will be
different by january of course they're
not
i was making the choice whether to to go
through on this travel plan or not and i
ended up not but i called my best friend
and just talked for like three hours
and i was like okay here's all the
things that could happen if i go here's
all the things that could happen if i
don't go
um and to make so to make a decision
we'll often use people as kind of
sounding boards
but i'm not actually talking about my
feelings in that scenario i'm talking
about the possibilities and i might say
things like oh i would feel guilty if i
got someone sick i would feel
um sad if i didn't get to go see my
community but
it's not a lot of emotional sharing it's
more like
like barfing out all of our thoughts
around something yeah and then
and then talking ourselves to our
emotional conclusion which is like yes
now that i've looked at all the
possibilities
i just know i just know that i feel
better about not going like i didn't
even have to communicate that i just had
the conversation oh
i feel that feeling in my body i know
it's done now i've made my decision
but it's not the same as effie sharing
all of its different feelings and then
looking for feedback on them
and then figuring out like what what
that is it's a very different process
yeah that i think that's a really really
big uh
distinction between enfj and enfp or f5
versus fe in general
yeah and it shows once again like even
that polarity of like you know f i and t
e versus like f e and t i um
because yeah even just literally this
morning like i was scrolling through my
twitter
drafts and i honestly i knew i had
drafts but i did not know i had
that many and i was scrolling through
them i was like
wow which is another you know thing that
i was like thinking about
um i think that enfjs are just like
incredibly meticulous like i get called
that like a lot
um and i think that's also why maybe
sometimes like they can appear as fake
but in
like i it really isn't like a fakeness
it's just all about like
i think a lot about timing like when is
the right time
to post this when is the right time to
present this information to this person
when is the right time
to do this when is the right time to do
that um and so with the same thing like
with drafts it's like okay kind of like
you said like
i had this thought whoa but then i'm
like reading the room it's like
is this the right time to tweet that or
and then ti is like have you fact
checked this
like yeah no what if you tweet this
and then it's actually wrong and then
all of a sudden this intp
um points like pokes holes in it now
your fe is like oh no my credit
and then you have to like delete the
tweet and you have to go
back and you're like man i wish i never
tweeted that kind of thing so it's like
all of these drafts are like you know i
have to like go through and think like
not only
is this accurate to be able to send out
to the community in the group
so that you know like for ti and then
for fe sake i won't lose faces like
credibility or
you know whatever or being embarrassed
by somebody poking holes in it
but also nise like is this the right
time to which is um i think is very
interesting because one time you talked
about how
n e s i at least from how i was
understanding it
it doesn't really look necessarily at
like timing
because n e the way i'm envisioning it
is like there's
portals everywhere endless portals like
there's always opportunity there's
opportunity everywhere that you look
just jump here just jump here
whereas like for me the way i view nise
it's like there's a small window of
opportunity
that you have to wait wait wait
wait now and then you you jump in it and
it's like
that like when you find that that's
where everything is like the most
poignant you know um and then when you
have fe there then it's like okay
that window of opportunity is now also
based off of like
you're you're looking at the social
like the social temperature like is it
you probably shouldn't tweet that right
now when there's um
riots going on at the capitol you know
or you should probably not like you know
do this right now you should probably
not promote this or whatever like you
have to like read like how is this going
to be received is this the right time is
that the right time
oh this is the perfect time you have to
do this on that day or else
you've missed your opportunity almost
forever almost forever because sometimes
that opportunity may come back around
but now you have to wait even longer and
then you start to think like dang well
if i had just
jumped in the first time then you know
i wouldn't have had to wait you know and
had to like push back that time skill
whereas like for
um nesi users i've seen that
like they don't really seem nearly as
concerned with that kind of timing
i would say almost not at all and yeah
it's funny because
i'm hearing you talk i think the only
time i've even learned to be concerned
about timing is if i've made the mistake
of not factoring that in which i'm very
prone to do like like you said my world
view is very like
there are always possibilities so let's
look at what possibility makes the most
sense right now and then once we get
to the end of that possibility or to a
new place with that possibility there'll
be more possibilities then we'll pick
the possibility that makes the most
sense then
but there have been maybe a few times in
my life where i've kind of
gone for something and been like oh that
wasn't the right time for that like that
just didn't i didn't
maybe i didn't wait long enough to let a
certain idea boil
and like come to fruition before i tried
to act on it or or whatever it was or
didn't give other people enough time to
get on board with something
um so there have been a few instances i
can think of in my life and i really
mean maybe like two
where i think oh the timing wasn't right
and and nfj's listening are probably
like
ugh they are
so much about timing too and then with
the se inferior it's like oh no
i've missed it you know but yeah i
literally i
literally can think of two times ever
where i look back and i'm like oh maybe
that that was the wrong timing for that
but what's funny is like then it even
becomes an
s.i thing for me so it's not like oh
then i get this running
theme of timing in my life afterwards
it's just like oh if i come across a
similar opportunity i'll just assume
like
don't do it at all because because i
think like oh the last time i i messed
it up
and then i'll almost just get paralyzed
in that area
overall because si is not especially
when it's inferior it's not great at
distinguishing like what the
context is it just kind of goes this
didn't work last time it's not going to
work this time but
and i have to consciously be like no
let's think about timing this time let's
think about all these different
variables that ni naturally thinks about
but um s-i-n-e doesn't so it's like yeah
timing for me is something that barely
exists in my world view and when it does
it exists
in a very inaccurate way like it's just
like like kind of
taking one thing and applying it to
something else without context and like
yeah it's it's very rarely on my radar
that is so interesting i can't i can't
imagine
um life like that and i think that's
where the judger in enfj
comes from because it's like paying so
much attention to that and it's not
nearly as like free
spirited um but it's also not like rigid
like i said you know like with that flip
where it's like oh
yeah we didn't know that because since
that's where s e tertiary comes in like
oh yeah look there's a little pathway
over there
we can go explore that as long as after
we explore it
it's still somehow like taking us in the
same direction
it's still going um it's it's along the
way
and it's not just like some arbitrary
path
that might lead us elsewhere like how
you talked about like that sixth
option no we want to
continue to go toward that first option
um
maybe maybe there might be a second
option but usually we've taken so much
time
to figure out one of those like like
about that first option and we invest
all of our thought energy and time into
it so that whole
idea of like manifestation even like
you're kind of obsessing over this ni
vision and idea that now it seems like
everything in your life
is is a current that's like pushing you
during
like down that stream toward that end
vision um
and that's actually another question
that you know going off of that that i
wanted to ask you i've often thought of
n e and n i as kind of like
both want to explore and find treasure
um
but n e is like so ni is kind of like
in the plane and it sees x marks the
spot and it's like okay
that's it and it wants to go to that x
and dig more and more and more like
anyone gets like the center of the earth
with that
um whereas like n e is like oh yeah
there goes x marks the spot but
man it's so fun flying here like let's
let's just keep on flying
and and i said what are you doing the
the treasure is right there it's going
to be much more fun digging and then and
he's like
but if we start digging that's kind of
boring because it's so much more fun to
fly
there could be other x's and then and i
was like what do you mean there could be
other x's that
it's right there let's dig to that the
more time that we're spending flying
around
as fun as that might be to you we are
wasting time
where we could be you know getting you
know like to the meat of something which
it's funny that i use that you know term
like we're wasting time because
now i'm also assuming that any is like
well what is time what is wasting time
we can always
circle right back to that x and it's not
going anywhere
yeah no it's exactly like and it's okay
so
first thing i was thinking is um i hope
she's cool with me sharing this i think
she would be but
my partner's uh in isfp which they have
ni tertiary so it's like they do plan
their future using ni
that's the function they use for future
planning um and we were having a
conversation the other day where she was
like oh we never like we don't
plan you never make plans for our future
like do you not
like what what's that about like do you
not want me in your future and i'm like
what am i what are you talking about
fix different plans every single day
that i share with you for the future
but like ni doesn't recognize it as a
plan if it's not
like directed right so it's like because
i'm not like
taking all those plans and being like
okay here's where we'll be in five years
here's where we'll be in 10 years here's
where we'll be in 15 years
she doesn't recognize it as a plan but
to me i'm like oh i have 10
10 000 different things i would like us
to do together in the future and to me
that's a plan like it's like
i see you in all of those plans it's
just like they're not cohesive and
they're never gonna be like it's
that's never gonna be how my brain works
right and that's obviously
interpersonally that's something like
you can
you can find ways to converge like the
any and the ni plans
but definitely it's like what's exciting
to us is flying over
looking at where all the x's are marked
and being like oh that's
i like knowing that's there i like
knowing that's there and then what we'll
often do is like take note like we want
to kind of get a bird's-eye view take
note of where all the x's are
and then maybe form a plan around like
okay we're going to hit this x then this
x then
this x but it's not particularly
interesting to
to drill too deeply into any of them
maybe some of them um
but we're always going to want different
kind of like a lot of variety in what
we're pursuing so
i like to think of it even as like i
took um
a workshop with uh dario nardi talking
about his book on self-leadership
and um like through the lens of
cognitive functions
and he was talking about how if you
don't value ni you just kind of have to
find a way to make it support
the dominant processing function that
you are using so for me it's ne
and that means maybe looking at common
themes in your life and figuring out
like okay
i do want to build in this area like for
me i know there will always be some
interest in typology and self-growth and
personal um i'm just like knowing
yourself
and so how do i kind of draw a common
thread through that and then give myself
a lot of different jumping points off of
that thread so it's like the way i look
at my career now
is kind of like a tree where it's like
okay the the
like trunk of the tree is you know my
love for
all the things i love for for bringing
people together for
like exploring personal development for
getting to know myself and other people
better which has been a consistent theme
that my si can recognize has always been
there in my life since i was a you know
as long as i can remember that's been a
passion and then there's going to be all
of these branches that are the roots i
take along the way like for a while
it'll be
you know doing this coaching program for
a while it'll be writing a book for a
while it'll be just going on twitter and
engaging a lot and reading a lot of
books and talking to the community
but it will always come back to these
core things
um and that's kind of rooted in si and
fi for me like i can
i look back over my life and go what
have i always loved what have i always
felt connected to
and that's how i know what to center
myself in and then any will be all of
these branches and leaves and
the fruit that grows on those branches
and leaves um but there's always going
to be another branch and i'm always
going to perceive a million different
branches i could grow and that's that's
cool too that's just how it works
um but that's kind of like how i view
the nefi or
or any ti is probably similar um
psyche it's like it's like a tree with a
lot of different
like variances like and then kind of
sidebars
yeah that makes total sense that makes
total sense that's actually really
beautiful to think of that way
um and then it yeah it definitely also
aligns with that whole x marks the spot
idea and just like flying around like
i'm i'm
definitely seeing how it makes sense now
from like an enfp perspective because
like i said like you know
things like that for me it's just always
been like what are you doing
yeah and it's just like and i've been in
conversations with
um any users before where for me
in my head the x marks the spot is
what i think like i i would like to
believe that i'm looking for
empirical truth um and
uh not just like oh you know
you know let's just think of this theory
let's just think of that theory or like
you know like
whatever like because that could you
know make sense and it could work and it
could be fun to explore that
but like is it empirical though is it
like you know what the actual
potential like as much as we can observe
absolute truth is
so that's what the x marks the spot is
at least for me
um however i am wondering like so then
as an enfp
uh because i know that you know enough
there has to be enfps as well who are
also looking for like empirical truth
and stuff and like what you also said
about like
oh x marks the spot like looking at all
of the different x's and then seeing
okay we're gonna visit that we're gonna
visit that
um with enfjs there
are nfjs in general njs in general
they're most
known for being like a visionary in the
sense that they
their ni is able to see exactly what's
going to play out like that
one most pop plausible thing that's
going to play out which is again my
empirical truth or x marks the spot um
how is that for the n e user especially
like as an enfp like
would you say that oh no i know
that that's the x marks the spotlight
that's the one that's most likely going
to play out but
i just don't feel like thinking too much
about it um
or it's like actually you know what's
going to most play out
i just have fun continuing to generate
more possibilities of what might play
out and then
i can adapt when it happens yeah so
that's that's an awesome question and
there was a really interesting
thread on twitter about this a while
back i think it was um
megan lavoda i can't remember if she
started it or if she just
said the comment that i'm remembering
the most um but she was saying or
someone on that thread was saying
that they're surprised that n.e is never
surprised
like i believe it was megan she was who
also has a great youtube channel that if
you guys aren't following you should go
check out but she was saying like oh
i'll be kind of so focused on one thing
that i think is likely to happen and
then if something different happens i'll
be really surprised
but the any valuing friends i have will
be like oh yeah that happened
of course like and i think that's very
reminiscent of the fact that any
considers all the possibilities
but doesn't put a lot of thought into
they can't put thought into it but they
don't put as much thought into which
one's most likely
um i think that's less true for entps
and intps because they have ti which is
like all about calculating probability
and likelihood
but um especially for enfps and infps we
think of everything that could happen
but we're not very concerned with
figuring out which one is most likely
because we're like well we'll find out
when we see what happens
like we're just like well there's no
there's not a lot of use in trying to
predict things
because we'll just know when we get to
the future like it will it will become
evident when we get there so we will
think a lot about
a lot of different things that could
happen because it's fun it's like a
playground to think of all the different
things that could happen
and then for that reason like we're not
often
surprised by things that do end up
happening because it's like yeah that
was always one of the possibilities
um but we're not too
um attached to any one possibility as
the most likely one
so it's not something that we put a lot
of time into focusing on because again
we don't plan in the same way like i
think another reason why
um ni naturally makes predictions
maybe not why but it's like it's related
is because they also plan around those
things so it's like if you're making a
long-term plan of course you have to
look at the
it's like looking at the weather
forecast right you need to know if
you're gonna wear like a rain jacket
tomorrow if you're gonna
wear a tank top and it's like any
isn't really making long-term plans in
the same way so it's kind of like oh
well i don't need to know the forecast
because it's like i'll just figure out
when i get there what i'm gonna do and
like look at the different options so
it's like it's not as
concerned with figuring things out it's
just not
um it doesn't capture like our our
attention won't stay there for very long
yeah and it's very handy because any in
itself is
capable of adapting in that environment
like because for me it's like well
i won't have my raincoat so i can't just
adapt
now i have to suffer and be all you know
broody in the rain whereas like and he
will somehow just find something like i
can't even think of like you know
how that would work so i was like i need
to be able to think
it's like to follow the metaphor i think
it's it's kind of interesting because
it's like
ni will have an this changes for any as
we grow up like
another thing dario nerdy said to me
once that was really funny was like he's
like around middle age you start seeing
enough peas who have standards for the
first time
but it's like to us there is this
element of like
being caught in the rain is no better or
worse than being caught in the sun it's
just a different experience so it's like
if i'm getting wet i'm getting wet and
i'll learn something from being wet
you know and it's like if i'm if i'm if
i happen into wonderful weather then
it's time to celebrate and if i happen
into bad weather it's time to grow and
and to
to learn so it's like we're we're just
kind of
interested in sampling all of the
experiences positive or negative
so we're not necessarily as concerned
with like oh am i gonna have the right
things to cope with this scenario when i
get there because we're like well it
will be an opportunity to learn them if
we don't
um yeah at another point that i've
immediately forgotten but
yeah well for everyone watching now you
can clearly see the difference between
like oh like i have definitely spoken to
people who are like
you know i used to be well this is not
people
technically one person said this but i
know that a lot of people share this
philosophy
like i used to be an enfj but now my p's
become a little bit more
and all of that and it's like no no no
that's not how this works then your
whole
cognitive function's not going to change
but i think that we can like clearly see
here like the difference in that like
judger versus like perceiver mentality
that even though like i see myself as
like
a judger but i also like see like i take
pride a lot of times in my spontaneous
moments like even on my youtube
channel like i have um a running
theme for some of my videos called
spontaneous speaking videos where it's
like oh
a thought or something popped up in my
head let me just pull out my ipad
wherever i'm
at flip it up and just start talking it
out with my
youtube subscribers um and i call that
spontaneity
you know and it's like yeah i'm so proud
of myself but then
jamila who's a perceiver isfp she's like
you just love like relishing your like
spontaneity or whatever but you're not
like
like like it's just further shows how
you're not really spontaneous
and i thought that was funny and then i
of course watch your videos heidi and
one thing that i found was interesting
was that because
for me that's coming from my tertiary se
i believe yeah
um and you uh it seemed
like i think we both have this in common
where we think of our cognitive
functions as like that inside out
kind of you know there's and everything
so when i was watching your videos i
thought it was interesting to see that
like te
which is your tertiary seems to be the
one that's like
guys like like it seems like the one
that you're
most proud of yes um and
not necessarily brag on but like that's
kind of like the idea that i was getting
like oh like
we're pretty like like this i'm i'm the
mature one even though i'm the tertiary
and for sd i guess that's what i'm
talking about yep see how sponsored i'm
spontaneous here it's like
that's not really spontaneous no it's oh
my god it's so
true it's so true because it's like if
some
so this is another thread that someone
posted on twitter and i cannot remember
and i feel so bad cause i can't remember
who posted it but it was so good because
they were like
a good way to type is to think about um
how people want other people to perceive
them versus what people actually come to
them for
and it's like i want my tertiary tea so
enfps are often
very proud of themselves for like when
they're organized when they have their
together when they're kind of like
um you know figuring things out and
orchestrating things and making things
happen like enfps often
want to be known for their um
productivity
and their ability to like like get
done
but that's not our natural way of
functioning like we don't
we're not compulsively getting done
we're doing it once in a while and then
being really proud of ourselves we want
everyone to see it and we want everyone
to look at us and be like oh they're so
like if someone calls me organized or if
someone calls me like
a person who's like really productive or
like you know has their together
i'm like yes
i am the goddess of productivity tell me
more but it's like that's not who i
am like that's because that's not
naturally who i
am it's what i like people to see me as
um
but enfps kind of know that that's
that's
something they have to develop like if
you're honest with yourself as an enfp
you know that
you're naturally not organized you have
to kind of build that skill
um and you do build it and it starts to
feel good and natural and more normal
but if you're super proud of how
organized you are you're like you might
be a p
because it's like the things that come
naturally to you you don't need to feel
like a sense of like i want external
validation for this because you just
know you know it's not like
as an enfp i don't feel any pride over
the fact that i'm very like emotionally
self-aware or whatever like it's like i
just spend so much time thinking about
my own emotions that it's like i don't
need anyone to validate that in me i
just do it i do it whether anyone
notices or not
but i do need people to validate me for
the things that don't come as naturally
so it's like even thinking about what
you want other people to think of you as
that you kind of know you're not
is probably a good um indication of what
your type might be
so how does that come out for you then
with s-i because i know like
for me um i do like the idea of like you
know
like you know like being like like my
ability to
adapt that's what it is for me because i
think that a lot of times especially
like
like you know te for an enfp like that's
it's good to be seen as that
but then i think a lot of times like we
were talking about like with the enfj
profile and everything
i think that we get talked about a lot
for our se like oh yeah they don't think
long enough about their plans they don't
know they just do this
it makes us seem a little bit more like
um
what's the word almost like the f-e-s-e
loop kind of thing
it's like um and so then it's almost
like
okay i do kind of want to be seen as
like spontaneous
but it's not making me seem spontaneous
these profiles are making me seem as if
i don't put thought into whatever i'm
doing and that i'm more
there's a specific word impulsive and
it's like no
i'm not i'm anything but impulsive like
you know at least like he's personally
speaking people who know me like they
know i'm not impulsive i can be
spontaneous
in my own way but impulsive is a
different kind of sense
and so what i'd like for people to see
for me is like
ability to adapt and maneuver when plans
don't go the way that i want so that's
where it's like white with my
sd and that's how i'd want people to
perceive me but then my ti
inferior i want people to also perceive
me as like oh
he knows his stuff and i can i can
actually like whatever information that
he gives me i can trust
that even if it may not be right
it can it makes sense it's like able to
hold itself
up and that if i present to him new
information
then he will openly look at it and
like you know think about it and see the
consistency there
and he's adopting like you know truth
and everything so i can trust this man
as a teacher um and so that's kind of
like how i'd want to be like perceived
like
when it comes like these last two
functions
um but for you as an enfp like you've
already described like
te how is that for you also like with s
well it's interesting because as you're
saying that i'm wondering if all of us
just feel a little bit not seen in our
inferior in our introverted functions
because it's like people only see what's
on the outside right so it's like for
enfps they might see
um all of our idea generation and then
all of our like plans
in our ne and our te and for you they
might see like all of your people
orientation and then all of the things
you do with your se but they miss out on
that ni and that ti
and it's like that can be very true for
us as well i think like where the enfps
tend to feel not seen
is that we have a very very deep
and rich world of reflection that is
i've never
seen properly conveyed in type profiles
to be honest like because when you
combine introverted feeling and
introverted sensing
it's like we spend so
so so much time and this is often the
difference between esfp and enfp as well
just thinking about the past and
thinking about things we did in the past
and how we felt about them
and how they could have gone differently
like there's almost an obsessive
non-stop
reel of our past lives playing inside of
our minds
all the time and that doesn't get seen
very often in enfps
um or acknowledged or like it's not
something we interact with other people
about
but it's something that gets missed as
part of the essence of who we are
and i don't think we necessarily want
people to always know that or see that
but it's very very
very very present and we can get
anchored in past experiences
because of si um like i was tweeting the
other day about how
the tv show tales of the city um which
is a remake of an old show i never
watched the old one
but the main character i believe um one
of the main characters is an enfp
probably a six wing seven so she has
like her own distinct flavor but
the premise of the show of the rev the
reboot of it
is that this enfp character has left
this community she was a part of in like
i guess her twenties or something gone
off
built a life somewhere else married
someone and then in the
first episode of the reboot of the
series she's returned she's on a plane
returning to this old community because
she's like i just spent my entire
new life for like 20 years or however
long it's been thinking about my old
life
and how much more fulfilling it was and
replaying like the story of my old life
in my head
and i was like this is so so enfp like
just getting
so anchored in a point in the past when
you were really happy
and almost like obsessing about it at
the detriment of your current life and
your current experiences because we
don't have se so we don't
adapt to our current experiences in the
same way we get very anchored in what's
worked before
and so this entire series is about this
woman like returning and just being like
i'm going back to my old life
which i think is a very um it's a thing
that's very unique to people who use
s-i and f-i s-i gives you that anchoring
f-i gives you that story in your head
about it um where it's almost like
you're watching a movie all the time and
i think that those are that's a part of
the enfp's life that i never see
talked about or like very rarely see
talked about but it's
so so core to our identities
that's beautiful like that
that yeah that makes that shows so much
of how
enfps operate and i don't relate to that
and that's exactly right and it's like
you wouldn't
it's like that's the thing because it's
like there are such
specific things that are just so
poignantly like specifically
fi and there's so many things that are
so specifically ni that i don't relate
to
and it's like when you you know take the
hood off the car and look inside it's
totally different for the enfj and enfp
yeah wow that's yeah that's awesome i
think that
that's definitely going to be very
helpful for a lot of people who are torn
between the two because i really i
really can't
yeah i don't think i i can think of yeah
of an nfj
who has that kind of um nostalgia
yeah but i can definitely see that with
my younger sister
who's an inft yeah oh yeah they've got
it bad
in that department other infps that i
know
um and i can see that with two enfps
that i know wow like yeah that that's
that's
just such a beautiful way that you put
it um and i feel like this is really
cool because it's again
showing how on the outside we really do
look the same like even in our
excitement and everything
um but then internally things are so
different
i wanted to bring up possibly one more
thing
yeah i'm yeah anything we didn't get to
for you
okay cool cool cool um because i was i
was just now
rethinking about like you know how you
said with fe
you have to talk through our feelings
like other people stuff like that
um one time i was speaking to an intj
an infj and an isfp my wife
um and so we were
describing like like pretty much the
intj said something like
uh i said something along the lines of
like communication is
difficult um and the infj agreed
but the intj was pretty much like
communications like easy
in a way which is like interesting cause
i'm the enfj she's the intj so it's like
really is it really like easy
and i somehow we got to this metaphor
this analogy where
um we were talking about bowling and
long story short
i said that i'm focused
on you know making sure that i get a
strike
so i have so i'm like really focused on
the pins
and the bowling ball and like you know
everything to like make sure that
whatever i'm communicating is
communicated properly like tactfully
within the right information all of that
so that it lands the other person
correctly
whereas the intj said oh yeah i'm not
really focused
on getting a strike i'm just focused on
making sure that pretty much like my
technique is right
like that i um that i launched the ball
correctly which
you know will most likely get her the
strike
still but it's kind of like for her what
she was trying to say was that
i'm just so focused on being able to
expel
whatever it is that i'm feeling
accurately
and it's not up to me how other people
receive however i feel i'm just happy
that i expressed how i feel
um and jamila the icfp was like oh
that's
interesting and she kind of like also
agreed with that to an extent but then
she's a feeler dominant so it's like oh
well
but then me and the infj we were like oh
yeah no for us
it's like it's not just about expressing
how we feel because again we don't
really even know like how we feel
but but it's like i want to make sure
that
everything that i'm communicating to you
is like even like throughout this
conversation i i can't help but keep on
asking like did that make sense did that
make sense
and i think that's also why we can
become like long-winded because like
i'm really trying to make sure i get the
strike like do you understand
what i'm saying and let me see if i can
explain it this way let me see if i can
explain it that way
so as an enfp how would you
say that is for you it's so funny
because when you when you talk about
like long-windedness i have an infj
friend who always talks about how she's
so long-winded and she's like it drives
me crazy but like i just can't
like she's always talking about how
there's this thing this essence she's
trying to convey and so she just has to
say it 12 different ways or else she
feels like she hasn't properly
you know contextualized that thing and
maybe they're going to misinterpret it
as something else
and so i think ni really has that desire
to like properly convey something which
is what makes them long-winded any
is long-winded because we're just
talking out our thoughts till we arrive
at
what we think so it's like we're both
long-winded but it's directed for the
for the njs like they're trying to get
to a certain point
versus any formulate new points when
they're talking so
sometimes it helps us get to like some
realizations along the way but
um in general we're not trying to get at
anything specifically but
but communication it depends because
it's like oh
if what am i communicating right it's
like if i'm communicating let's say
something in a work sense where
something needs to be done
that's very easy because it's just
objective you use your te this needs to
be done please do it
if it's um communicating like a
philosophy or an idea or a thought
um i will be prone to explaining it
multiple different ways but i find that
it's fun
if it's communication in the realm of
like feelings
um it's not i don't find it particularly
difficult sometimes it can be
painful for me to extract my fi and make
it
seem unknown like i want to keep it
inside um
so if i'm sharing how i'm feeling it can
be painful like i don't want to
but i don't worry too much about like
the strike
like i'm just kind of like okay there i
said it like if i feel like there's
something i needed
to say got you and i was gonna just
sorry to interrupt i was just asking
like and that's not it would you say
that that's also influenced by
enneagram eight i would use
fi thing like altogether as well yeah i
think it's an f i thing but i think it's
a lot more so for me
because like i'm an enneagram eight i do
i really don't wanna share my feelings
like i have almost no desire to do that
until it's like
okay i have to or else like like it's
extremely important
in this relationship or whatever um that
i share how i'm feeling
so i i do know that other enfps will
want to share how they're feeling more
um but again i think for them it's more
about putting it out there and it's like
they don't need to
because we're not thinking about
influence in the same way that f
or fe is like i think fees always think
about influence even if it's not
intentional like not like oh i want to
influence someone to do something it's
like
what influence will the words that i say
have over other people's thinking
i think is a very prominent thought uh
for those in the feti access correct me
if i'm wrong
um yeah but that's not as prominent for
me like i'm just kind of like i'm saying
what i think i always i'm just saying
what i think and then you think whatever
you want you know like
i'm just sharing it in case it helps you
in any way or
if it's you know a thing that needs to
be shared in our because of our
relationship to one another
um but i'm not thinking about how is the
way i'm thinking gonna impact how
someone else is thinking
i'm just thinking well this is what i
think and they can think whatever and if
they think along the same lines as me
that's cool we'll probably chat about it
or vice versa if they think something
different but i'm not concerned with the
influence of what i'm saying
um i may be concerned with the impact so
if i want something to happen
i'll think what can i say that will make
this thing happen what can i share that
will make
this outcome be the outcome but yeah i'm
not
worried about influence in terms of um
the way i talk almost ever unless it's
particularly like i'm setting that
intention that is
yet another huge distinction
i believe for everyone who's watching
because for me as an enfj i guess
speaking for myself but
i feel like other enfjs would definitely
relate
i'm always once again like thinking
about that influence
i'm always thinking about that strike
like oh man there's one pin left like
what did i
how did i not communicate that properly
or like you know
and that's like for anything you know
like whether it is
you know i i can't i can't always just
you know
throw it like you know just throw the
ball like look at the technique i think
it's harder for me maybe in that sense
and it's just easier to focus more on
the pens and somehow i'll get that i
don't know
if that translates properly in the uh
metaphor but um but yeah
like i definitely get what you're saying
though and i feel like that's a really
that's definitely a big distinction once
again for like enfp
enfj um well it's it's like it's
i even think of it through the lens of
like and we'll wrap up in a minute here
we could just talk for like seven hours
but
yeah i was thinking about that
specifically the other day because i i
don't really use it anymore but i went
through a period for like six
six months or so where i was just
writing like i was writing a lot and i
was posting a lot of my writing on
instagram
and i would get messages sometimes from
people being like oh but this doesn't
apply to me in this situation and i'd be
like well of course like
not everything anyone says is gonna
apply to everyone i'm just sharing my
thoughts
and it's like you should think whatever
you want like i'm not telling you to
think this
like i was like i'm like taken aback
when people think that i'm telling them
to think something
cause i'm like no i'm just sharing what
i think and what my like life
philosophies are
but i really really don't think it's
gonna apply to everyone or expect it to
apply to everyone
um because there's context with
everything but that's a classic case of
me not thinking like oh other people are
interpreting this
as it is universal whereas i'm not um
and i i assume that the premise is that
it's not universal
but other people who who operate under a
different world view might think like oh
if someone's sharing something they
assume it to be universal
so i should think about it and integrate
it into my world view and i'm just kind
of over here like no
don't do that think think first
and this isn't to say that like oh um
other types like live critical thinking
but it's like oh it's
we're there are different bases bases
for the critical thinking that like
um the feti access versus the tefi
axis has so it's like it's interesting
that's a whole other conversation but
it's like
yeah but what we're assuming other
people are thinking critically about
like you and i
we probably have two completely
different bases for that yeah exactly
yeah and just like what we were saying
before like you know
because if i maybe i didn't if maybe if
i assume that everybody operated like me
then it's like all right well you're
posting this so clearly
you are saying that you know it's like
universal because i wouldn't have posted
that until i exactly maybe
this universal and even if i wasn't
necessarily sure
you know me heidi i always like put a
disclaimer but like but what are your
thoughts what are you gonna say
like i'm actually still figuring this
out but i'm looking for the universal
and then what i've realized especially
with those who have te
it's like okay i'm stating this and it
sounds like i'm speaking
as if it's objective and universal but
honestly
like no you're always welcome to uh come
and like
you know shuffle with me and it's just
like
but you didn't make it sound like you
were open to that it's like
because you're just supposed to assume
that and it's like but how am i supposed
to assume that
if you shared something that you didn't
necessarily like
really dig into and make it seem like
universe was like because
so yeah like that's exactly because
we're arriving at like landing points
where we're like okay i've landed on
this thought for now but it's like we
know that that's not
that's not the whole system but we're
just kind of like oh i'm just
identifying this as a landing point but
there's a million other ones and maybe
you're at a different one so it's like
yeah it's a very funny um it's a very
funny difference because it's like
that's so true like tefi in either order
i think
sounds we speak very decisively a lot of
the time
but but we're not as decid like we're
not
feeling as decisive maybe as people
assume we are
so it's like like i'll read my own
twitter and be like oh my god if i read
this i would think i was like
like i would just think i was so
opinionated about all these things but
i'm like
these are all just passing thoughts i've
had half of them i don't even think
are true anymore or i now see great
nuances or whatever but it's like i just
speak very decisively so that gets not
communicated
um but yeah i think that's very much
like
f-e-t-i will even correct itself a lot
while speaking whereas t-e-f-i will just
be like it's like this
because we think it's generalities in
that sense so yeah it's very different
communication styles for sure yeah yeah
yeah yeah
okay and just in conclusion i guess like
the last thing i was like okay we have
to throw this one in there
heidi one time gave an analogy as
often as she does beautiful analogies of
f i versus
f e um so just in case for whatever
reason you have not been following fi is
what enfps have and then
but um uh she said that you might
actually have to share it again the well
analogy
so it's like yeah yeah yeah so the way i
kind of think of
effie versus fi is like if you are
sitting at the bottom
of a well it's like fi is gonna be the
function that
crawls down and like sits with you and
is like i'm here with you we're
experiencing this together
you know i remember another time i was
in a dark well and there's just a lot of
like empathizing for what you're feeling
versus fe is gonna be the one who like
throws a ladder down is like i will help
you out of the well
yes exactly yes yeah and i thought
that was like a very quick easy way to
like
again of course you know you can always
like nuance it out better
not saying that fe could never do that
but i think that the the situations
where
fe would do that is
i tend to think of fe as uh somebody
described it my friend my infj friend
described it as
social anesthesia and then ti as
the scalpel and i was like that
is beautiful like that's that's
literally
yeah that's literally how i see it and
so for me
um the only way that i would climb down
into that well
is if i knew that the ladder for you to
get you out
would have to include me coming down
there with you so it's like okay my
whole goal
is to get you out of here because
personally as a fe user it's like
i do not see the point in you sitting
down there and i
do not see the point in me sitting down
there with you
but i do see the point if i have to sit
down there with you for like
20 minutes before you're ready to come
up so as long as we can
as long as we're gonna come up then you
know that's cool whereas like
i i feel like f i is
not even i feel like i'm positive the f
i is able to sit down there
exponentially longer than f e is able to
because
f e's like the way that uh antonio dodge
and entp
described it um fe is usually
just trying like again the social
anesthesia thing usually trying to like
soften things enough
so that they can like pull out their ti
scaffolds like yeah yeah
with some sort of like fix yeah and so
for me it's an enfj it's like
some people listening could probably
like oh so then you guys don't really
care no it's like no
that's how we show that we care the way
that we show that we care is because
we our care is like wait but you know
i'm thinking of like the incredibles
where
uh just randomly came to my head like
where mr incredible like jumped
and saved the man that was like falling
like trying to like kill himself
and he was like hey i saved your life
because the man sued him
and so he's like i was like hey life and
then the guy's like no you didn't you
ruined my death
and it's like no like in our head it's
like that was me demonstrating that
i love you that i shoot i do not like
sitting down here in this well
do you think i would have done that for
anyone i went down there with you and
even though i was watching the clock
and waiting for the opportunity to okay
now we've been here long enough i think
you're strong enough
for us to both climb up this ladder and
leave yeah that's my way of showing
i love you where it's like for f5's like
i'm showing you that i love you
by sitting here period and then fe user
might be like
you're not even trying to help me out
it's like well i didn't really know if
you wanted to come out of this
i just thought that you might need
company down here so it's really
interesting
nobody's wrong in how they view this but
this is how like fe
a ti might view that situation versus
like an f i t e user might view it
yeah and it's interesting because it's
like i think at the end of the day we
have the same goals but we have
different processes so it's like
i think fe first visualizes like okay
we're going to get them out of the well
how
versus and it's interesting because it
tracks with um the opposite function so
it's like
f-i-t-e i will think like oh i hope you
know my friends if they're
struggling or they're going through a
hard time that things get better and if
i can help them with that i totally want
to but
i think that i'm not capable of helping
them until i very deeply and fully
understand their emotional
mindset and situation so it's like i
need to sit down there for a long time
with them until i can figure out like
okay what's the best route out
versus if i know someone really well
like my best friend is an infp
she'll come to me with a problem we can
move to problem solving within like half
an hour because
which is fast for us because i know her
so well and i know her inner world
so well that it's like okay i already i
have this contextualized
already so we can move to problem
solving more quickly but if it's someone
i don't know as well
i'm like okay i have to similar to how
ti has to understand
everything about the system of thought
before it feels comfortable influencing
fi has to understand everything about
that person's emotional reality before
they can suggest what they should do
because i'm like i don't want to suggest
something and then it turns out that
makes it worse for them emotionally in
another area
so it's like my first instinct is to
empathize
and keep empathizing and keep
empathizing and you know share like make
tell them stories that make them feel
less alone and stuff and then once i'm
like okay i'm sure that i have
at least like 90 of the emotional layout
here now i feel like i can
offer some suggestions of what to do
that that
um wouldn't be ill-advised the same way
ti never wants to offer
information that it thinks would
influence someone in the wrong direction
so both of our end goals are the same
but the processes are very different
because we're coming in from like
different angles with it
yeah yeah for sure like i would
automatically feel
like in most situations like i do know
how to get us out of here um but
unfortunately
in order to be able to get us out of
here sometimes i do have to
not even unfortunately because it's not
as painful it depends on the situation
but it's like no i don't mind sitting
here with you
for 20 minutes or however and like
allowing you to be able to get it all
out and everything and empathizing with
you i i like to empathize so that's not
like to say that fe users
do not like to empathize that's totally
far from the truth of course
but it's like yeah like i feel like that
is again like it's necessary like that's
part of
that process of this is how i'm gonna
get you out
whereas like you know fi is like like
you just explain like it's not
it's going like in the reverse direction
like okay yeah sure i have to get like i
can get you up but like
i or i hope that you can get out but
like you said
i have to really sit there and absorb
and understand
and then that made me think like oh that
could potentially be the reverse
of like if i'm trying to help somebody
out of like a specific
world view that would probably be the
well that i would actually dive into
and i'd sit there with like okay oh
this is why you're satanist you know
i don't know and it's like oh you know
and it's like i cannot
you know sure i i i i don't even think i
can provide you a ladder until i
understand completely
why you have this you know these
thoughts or whatever so that that
so then it's flipped when it comes to
like what we
what our world view might be and like
that's where it's like okay i have to
really sit here and know
all of the information that you know
which is where my ni
and ti i guess comes in so it's like
okay i totally understand
everything all of your philosophies and
what you think over here
now i can probably help you come out or
maybe i might stay down here with you
you know because that makes
more sense i'm going to reject whatever
i believe i don't know something i hear
a lot from ti users that as a
te user i don't relate to at all is like
all
i mean i understand it but i don't like
feel it you know it's like all thoughts
all perspectives all ideas
all um opinions even like
wrong pieces of information are just
data points like it's like you need to
know
all of it right and wrong information is
both both of those things are important
as a tea user i'm like no wrong
information matters we should only have
the right information
like i i intellectually understand what
ti users are saying when they say that
like i'm like i get it on an
intellectual level but i don't feel
like having any sort of wrong
information is a good thing and i think
the same might be true
of effie with negative emotions because
i think so
yeah they're like why would you like why
have a negative emotion it's an
inherently bad thing the way i see like
incorrect information is an inherently
bad thing but for fi
it's like all emotions good and bad are
very important to understand because our
our desire is to understand the entire
emotional spectrum the same way ti's
desire is to like understand how all of
the information fits together
so it's like if i see a friend in a well
i'm like oh i might they might might not
even
need to get out of that well like i
could just maybe walk by say hello
wish them watch them well and like
go on my way right like i remember
having this conversation with um
in estp friend one time about another
friend of ours who was an enfp
and she was like yeah this this other
friend is just like making this series
of decisions that i think is just like
leading them in a very bad direction
and i was like and she was like oh how
are we gonna stop them and i was like we
don't stop them like they're
gonna go learn lessons that's the point
of life like
yeah it's gonna be a train wreck for
sure but it's like i think they know
that
like you usually know when you're
heading towards a train wreck especially
but it's like oh there's valuable
lessons to be learned
in the train wreck that i think they
seem to want to go learn so we should
just let them go learn them
versus like i think he's like no don't
go into train wreck like because they
don't see the value in that
um but fi does see the value and
negative emotions so we don't
mind um necessarily like even
if our friends are in the wild it's like
well maybe they want to be there i don't
know
it sees all of the emotions as piano
keys and there's no such thing as a bad
piano key it might be played in the
wrong
i love that yeah and the wrong note
might be played in like the wrong song
but in a different song it might be like
different context might be played
correctly
whereas like and this this was a big
epiphany for me having an isfp wife
because as an esj
i i literally did not learn this lesson
until last year september
[Laughter]
welcome to an intj and like uh
she was like so you're always trying to
keep jamila
in a happy state of mind and i'm like
yeah why
what kind of husband would not what kind
of significant other would not like
that's
but then i started thinking about it
from a typological standpoint i never
even thought
how that could be like for an fi user
like oh
they sometimes like negative emotions so
when she gets in her moods at times
randomly
i'm immediately like i gotta get her out
of the well like
you know i why are you unhappy whether
it's my fault or it's not my fault i
have to try to make you happy again
somehow um but maybe she wants to sit
down there
and i've been learning like to just like
you'd said
like oh she's in she's at the bottom of
the well right now
wish her well she knows i can't sit down
there for long
so we have that
she knows how to climb back up and find
me when she's ready and i will do my
part and not try to like force her back
on up
it's like oh are you you're back up here
cool let's get back to happy stuff but
she asked me jamila asked me like
something so like you
like always being happy and i'm like
yeah the only time like i probably like
will not like being happy or something
is like or i want to be angry like
if it's like an injustice for other
people
get angry and i'm like no we have to do
this for black people or
boom boom it's like it's like the
negative emotion serves a better
purpose so it's like then it matters but
it's like yeah for us
it's yeah it's interesting because i've
noticed that difference myself like
even with my fe valuing friends or like
i have this one memory of like
this effie user i dated who like i was
having a bad day one day
and she was like okay go take a bath i
was like very insistent about it and i
was like i don't understand like
do i smell like what's going on and
she's like no just go take a bus i went
and took a bath and i came out of the
bath and she'd like cleaned the whole my
whole apartment it was not our mutual
apartment it was my apartment
cleaned the whole apartment like like
laid out all of my favorite foods had my
favorite music playing and i was like
this is such a foreign function
what is this you're just trying to make
me feel better like what
but it's like and then it's like my
current partnership because we're both
fi users it's like one of us is having a
bad day it's like oh we're gonna sit
down and
analyze that that day like and it's and
both things are needed in different
situations right
but it's just so funny that it's like
one is always more foreign to us than
the other so it's like it's probably so
weird to you
to go to your partner and be like oh
you're having a bad day let's talk about
all your bad feelings like what else do
you feel that's bad but it's like
that's what if i want sometimes and in
the same vein i'm like oh it's very
weird to me if i'm having a bad day and
someone just tries to like make my day
better
that's what effie does and it's like
both are needed it's just like like
everything about context
so maybe that even like wraps it up
nicely as
you know all of these functions are
super wonderful and super important
um it's just about figuring out which
ones you're using
like enfj enfp no one is better or worse
than the other but they are
radically different so it's just about
like figuring out what's accurate for
you as opposed to figuring out like oh
which one is it like better to be which
i think a lot of people kind of approach
type with the
thought in their head of and it's not
about that at all
exactly fully agree yeah this was
very very very enlightening for me um
like yeah so i'm always excited to be
doing videos with you
per usual and it's so awesome to
continue to be learning from you
um and i'm pretty sure this will be
helpful to a lot of people watching
yeah if you guys have questions um let
me know in the comments i'm not always
great about questions in the comments
but please find me on twitter heidi
preeb1
and i will answer your questions there
because i'm very good at answering
twitter notifications
and make sure you're following denzel if
you aren't already again so i will link
his youtube
uh in the comments it's an awesome
channel and he also has he's also very
active on twitter do you want to drop
your
twitter handle yeah on twitter i'm dz2
underscore bless so that's d e e
z y the number two and then underscore
blessed
well thanks if you're still here thank
you guys for watching for this long we
hope that clarified some stuff for you
if you're confused about enfp versus
enfj or if you just want to learn more
about the types
before we started i was like oh this is
just going to be a giant
it's going to be metaphor city like me
and denzel are going to
get on a call and we're not going to
talk about a single tangible thing we're
just going to give a million
various metaphors so hopefully that was
helpful for you
probably if you're an intuitive that was
helpful for your censor that might have
been like
but we're gonna actual use
that digging treasure pirate ships
that's the summary
[Laughter]
hopefully that was helpful for you guys
and
yeah we'll see you next time
