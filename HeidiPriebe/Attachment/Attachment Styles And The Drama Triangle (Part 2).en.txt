hey guys heidi preeb here today we are
doing part two of a video that i
released the first part of last week
it's called attachment styles and the
drama triangle part one
uh introduction to the drama triangle
something along those lines
and today we're going to be talking
about what it looks like when each of
the three insecurely attached types are
stuck in the drama triangle so that's
anxious avoidant and fearful avoidant
which is a term that's interchangeable
with
anxious avoidant or disorganized
attachment it's not
technically interchangeable but in terms
of pop culture words that you might hear
floating around
it's like interchangeable enough that it
works here
so before we get started i want to
reiterate or maybe just iterate because
i don't know if i've said this
before that all of these attachment
strategies exist because they worked at
one time
so the anxiously attached person's
starting gate role in the drama triangle
is usually the victim role
and this is a role that actually makes a
lot of sense for this style because
very early on in life people who are
anxiously attached learned that their
caregivers could co-regulate with them
so what that means is that
when they were upset when they needed
something because they were quite
literally a dependent
human being that's what babies are um
and they cried and showed their
vulnerability and got their parents
attention their parent would
always or to the best of their abilities
give them love and nurturance and
whatever
they needed however their parent was not
always available
so what this child learned was that i
have to try and try and try to get my
parents attention
but when i do get it i will be given
love and co-regulation
and i will feel okay again but the
problem is that the anxiously attached
child did not learn self-regulation
so what that means is that they really
have trouble understanding that they can
give themselves that same sense of peace
and love and
regulation they think that they need
someone else to help them get there
so the anxiously attached person
perpetually feels a little bit like
half of a hole in their lives so they
tend to get really attracted to and
drawn into
um stories about like finding your other
half and finding your soulmate and
feeling complete at last through a
partner and this isn't something that
they choose to do it's just a virtue of
their psyche that developed around this
because
they never learned self-regulation so
they didn't really learn i can make
myself feel okay i can meet my own needs
i can meet my own wants
on my own without the help of another
human being so
what that looks like in adulthood is
that the anxiously attached person is
kind of going around
unconsciously looking for a parent
figure not a partner
and this is actually not that different
from how we look at love and
relationships through the lens of the
media right there's this like romantic
notion that we'll meet someone who
loves all of our flaws away and who
helps us finally see life differently
for the first time and
there aren't a lot of stories about
people just learning to do that for
themselves and people learning to
complete their own lives
um they're not as sexy and they're not
as exciting because
they don't push on attachment wounds um
and the problem is that if you're
anxiously attached
you take all of those stories quite
literally because there is an
unconscious desire inside of you
already to find that other half so
anxiously attached people are
unconsciously
always going around looking for someone
who's like a parent figure and who looks
like a parent figure
avoidant personalities why avoidantly
attached people
don't emote their needs or wants so they
have a lot of needs and wants they have
a lot of internal issues just like the
anxiously attached person
they have approximately as many internal
wounds okay and that is a lot that is
not a small amount
of internal wounds however the avoidance
strategy is to pretend that they don't
have anything going on and to minimize
and to neglect those needs so what this
looks like
is kind of a parent figure because the
avoidant is constantly giving off this
aura of everything's fine nothing to see
here
i have no problems or challenges even
much more so than securely attached
person
who actually is working in real time
through their challenges and problems
and solving them
the avoidant because they're suppressing
them looks on the surface
like they have everything 100 together
and to the anxiously attached person
that looks like a parent figure
because parents when they have a small
child if they're doing it right don't
burden the small child with their
problems
they act like things are okay that's a
normal part of parenthood
however it's not a normal part of being
a healthy adult in a relationship
but to the anxiously attached person an
avoidant person who does act like this
it sends off that alarm bell in their
brain okay here's the parent figure i've
been looking for right so we get a lot
of anxious people chasing avoidant types
now the problem is that the avoidant is
not a real parent figure they're not
interested in endlessly responding to
emotional needs but the anxiously
attached person unconsciously assumes
now it's time to start my normal
activation
strategies when i want the attention of
my partner the same way i used to get
the attention of my parent
by playing the victim and showing my
vulnerabilities and this
isn't a conscious choice okay so the
anxiously attached person is not going i
will take this victimized stance and i
will make my situation
a thousand times more dramatic than it
actually is sometimes they are but more
often than not
they just believe that if i press hard
on the bruise
of whatever hurts my parent figure will
come running to me so when they go into
conflict
they tend to take this position of i'm
so hurt i'm so in need of help
they will over inflate and over
exaggerate the things in their life that
they need help with because they learned
early on that was the way that you get
the attention
of the person who you're attached to and
the problem is that as an adult
that's more likely to push someone like
the avoidant partner
away because the avoidant partner really
fears their boundaries being crossed
and the anxiously attached person is
unconsciously trying to cross their
boundaries to get what they need from
them because they feel kind of like they
will die without it
and again all of this is operating deep
under the surface the main thing that
the anxiously attached person will feel
in conflict
is just stress and wanting to be close
and wanting to connect and wanting to
feel like okay
even if i have to give up something or i
have to compromise my own boundaries i
just want to feel close to this person
and that's because unconsciously
they believe that that person is going
to meet all of their needs so in
conflict the unconscious mantra that's
always happening for the anxiously
attached style
is i will only be happy once you meet my
needs which sounds
exactly like the victim role in the
drama triangle now something that's
really interesting is that in pop
culture i feel like the anxious
attachment is kind of idealized a little
bit
like they're kind of looked at as oh
these poor people who didn't get the
proper love and now they need their
other half
but when you read actual attachment
literature they talk a lot about the
controlling nature and the controlling
patterns of the anxious style
so the anxious style might not be
controlling in the way that you
stereotypically think
of let's say an abuser in a relationship
they might be they might they very well
might be
um but they are always trying to control
the way that their partner feels about
them
so they don't want to give their partner
an autonomous experience of living where
their partner gets to decide for
themselves what they like and don't like
and where their own boundaries are
the anxiously attached person really
really feels the need on a deep level to
make sure that their partner is always
feeling
extremely um connected to them aligned
with them on the same page as them
because again otherwise they won't be
able to get that co-regulation and they
don't know how to self-regulate
so if they don't get that co-regulation
they feel like they're gonna die so a
lot of the behavior that they're
engaging in really is quite controlling
and it's quite manipulative of their
partner and all of the insecure
attachment styles
have a form of manipulation that they
rely on to get their needs met in
relationship this isn't exclusive to the
anxious style
but this overt form of wanting to
emotionally control the other person is
fairly prevalent in the anxious style
even though you would be
very hard-pressed to find an anxious
person who will admit to that
because again it runs so deep that they
don't necessarily notice that that's
what they're doing
they think that this is a normal way to
behave in partnerships usually
so when an anxiously attached person
goes into conflict they are
over inflating their needs over
inflating what's going on over inflating
what their partner needs to fix
for them and the only way to get out of
this is to switch into the role in the
empowering dynamic that mirrors the
victim role
which is the creator role so when you're
in creation mode
you look at not just which options are
available to you interpersonally but
which options are available to you
independently
so being a creator means looking at
everything that you have the choice to
engage with and figuring out what's
healthiest for yourself
and when you're in creator mode you
inherently understand that you do not
have control over other people
okay you don't get to pick how your
partner feels about you you don't get to
pick how your partner responds to you
you don't get to pick what kind of
interaction you have with your partner
you can only control
your side of things and if it doesn't go
well
you have other options so being in
creator mode as an anxiously attached
person
means you have to change your vantage
point from how do i get my partner to
meet my needs
to how do i get my own needs met even if
my partner can't
or won't or just isn't interested in
meeting them so step one
is often just figuring out what is my
deep need here so not the surface level
need which is i need my partner to
behave a certain way right
take your partner out of the picture and
ask yourself what am i feeling let's say
i'm feeling emotionally neglected
okay go deeper than that what does
emotional neglect mean well
it means that i feel pretty bad about
myself because i feel like i'm not
getting love okay well what does that
mean it means that if i am not
in some way validated i will feel like i
am an inherently unlovable person
okay there's your real feeling right i
am unlovable
so who's not giving you the love that
you need oldest cliche in the book
but it's you you will forever forever as
an anxiously attached person
or any other style feel like your heart
is a bucket that has a hole in the
bottom if you do not
learn how to deeply love and care for
yourself when you're alone
so if you 100 feel like you need your
partner or
other people to validate you and give
you what you need in order to feel loved
you are always always always going to be
stuck in the drama triangle right the
drama triangle
is when you're feeling like i will only
be happy once you change
and that you can be your partner it can
be your parent it can be your best
friend it can be society
it can be an entire range of things but
as long as you're feeling that way that
you need something
outside of yourself to feel okay you're
in the drama triangle
so the anxiously attached person needs
to learn on a
really really deep level and this takes
work
it really does how to show up for
themselves and build a relationship with
themselves
the way that they usually focus on
building relationships with other people
and the beginning of your healing as an
anxiously attached person
will really be to think of the
relationship you have with yourself the
way that you think of the relationships
you build with other people
so if you really wanted to date someone
would you show up on time to your first
date would you keep your commitments
would you
buy them little gifts and write them
little love letters
and think constantly about ways that you
could show them that you care about them
are you doing those things for yourself
do you show up for yourself when you
really want to get something done
even if you're tired or exhausted or
feeling emotional and don't really want
to
do you buy yourself little gifts do you
speak kindly to yourself do you spend
quality time with yourself
are you deeply aware of your own needs
and what you need to do in order to
fulfill them
the way that you're aware of other
people's needs and if the answer is no
you're probably stuck in the drama
triangle and you really need to take
some time to cultivate that relationship
with yourself
because it doesn't just happen overnight
if you have been neglecting yourself
your entire life
you can't just say a couple of mantras
and then expect your relationship with
yourself to be healed
you have to do the hard work of getting
to know yourself getting to know your
wants and needs
doing some trial and error around how to
fulfill those wants and needs
understanding yourself on a deep
emotional level what motivates you what
are your passions what are your goals
what are your dreams in life
literally date yourself the way you
would date another person and put
all of the care and attention into
yourself that you would put into someone
else
and just imagine what a world of
difference that would make
because if you have this strong
self-sufficient relationship with
yourself
when you're in conflict with someone
else you can stay calm and you can stay
regulated
because you understand that their
choices are their choices
and if they're not interested in meeting
your needs or your wants
that's okay because you know how to do
that for yourself and if you need to
you can remove yourself from the
situation and you can either be alone
for a period of time
or you can find a different partner
who's more aligned with what you want
but there won't be this
undying desperation to get the other
person to see your point of view
and to fix your needs for you and what
this means is unconsciously taking
yourself
out of the fantasy that you're going to
meet your soulmate who's going to be
able to anticipate every one of your
needs
understand you in a way that no one else
has ever understood you and suddenly
make you feel really excited to live
your life again okay
partners don't do that that's not the
role of a partner it just feels like it
is because of your unconscious
programming
and once you learn what a healthy
partnership is which is two people who
can take care of their own needs the
same way they would if they were single
but then they go to each other to share
an experience of life and show support
for each other as they move through
challenges
then you can start having an actual
healthy adult relationship
and this is hard and it's something
you're probably gonna have to remind
yourself of over and over and over again
i still do that for myself in
partnerships when i feel a sense of
need or desperation to get my needs seen
and met i ask myself if i were single
what would i do about this need
i'd probably find a way to make myself
feel better maybe through taking a day
for self-care and giving myself
quality time or i'd phone a friend and
talk about it or i would do some work to
try to self-regulate
and if you're not able to do that you're
probably not ready to be in a
relationship in the first place because
your partner meeting your needs
should always be an option not a
necessity okay your wants
they can meet the point of a
relationship is two people coming
together
and choosing to want each other and to
want to make each other's lives better
if the relationship is based on a
fundamental need for one another
you are going to be trapped in the drama
triangle the entire way through
unless and until you start healing these
wounds and a really great resource that
i actually recommend for
people who are struggling with anxious
attachment or to overcoming shit's
attachment
is codependence anonymous it's a 12-step
program so it's a branch off of aa
and i've historically been very
skeptical about 12-step programs
but i have read the code of handbook and
i have to say it's an
awesome awesome resource for people who
are struggling
with anxious tendencies whether that's
the anxiously attached style or the
fearful avoidance style and i'm gonna
mention this again when we talk about
fearful avoidance
because the first step the premise of
the program that you have to accept
is we are powerless over others
and if you can accept that premise on a
deep level as an anxiously attached
spectrum type so that's anxious or
fearful avoidant it will completely
and totally and irrefutably change the
way that you approach relationships
every single time you go into an
argument and you want to play the victim
or you want to show the other person how
much you're hurting
remind yourself i am powerless over
others and if that were true if that
were true and you were truly powerless
to manipulate in any way what someone
else thinks or feels towards you
how would you behave how would you take
yourself out of that situation how would
you care for yourself
because when you're thinking about it
from that lens all of a sudden more
options become available to you
you realize if this person is going to
behave this way and i'm powerless
to change their behavior their thoughts
or their emotions maybe i need to
reevaluate whether or not this is the
right person for me to be dating
whether this is an emotionally safe
situation for me to continuously put
myself in
and what a better option for myself
might be and when you have that
relationship with yourself and you have
self-trust because you've built it you
no longer want to put yourself in
situations
where people are not taking your
feelings or your desires seriously it is
not your partner's job to make sure that
your relationship is an emotionally safe
place
it is your job as an autonomous human
being
to make sure that you are refusing to
put yourself
in unsafe situations and we'll talk
about this in future videos but there is
a lot of re-parenting work you might
have to do
a lot of visualization you could do
where you literally ask yourself
if i had a young child in this situation
would i subject them to this situation
or would i get them out and if you can
start looking at yourself as someone
who has a little kid inside of them that
needs that safety and needs those
emotional boundaries
you're going to be able to start
treating the relationship differently
there's this quote
by sherry argov i don't know who that is
but um it goes truly powerful people
don't explain why they want respect they
simply don't engage with people who
don't give it to them
and that is the mantra of the secure
style right you don't have secure people
going and begging other people to
respect them and to pay attention to
them
and to care about their needs when they
meet a person who doesn't want to do
that they just go oh
that person's got something funny going
on they aren't very emotionally
available so i'm gonna
get out and find someone who is because
they don't have that soulmate fantasy
that someone's gonna fix all their needs
right
and any of the insecurely attached
styles can learn that mindset is the
beauty of this
so this isn't a death sentence if you
are anxiously attached
you can get better and the first thing
you have to do
is accept that you are powerless over
people
you are responsible for meeting your own
needs and that you are responsible for
putting yourself
in situations where you're able and
capable of taking care of yourself
a lot of the time that means taking
yourself out of situations where you're
dysregulated but that's all going to
come through trial and error
as you heal your style and as you start
to learn where your healthy boundaries
are
all right let's talk avoidance so
avoidance tend to
like to think that they are never in the
drama triangle they think that they are
completely self-sufficient they meet all
of their own needs
they don't have a broken attachment
style most avoidance self-identify is
secure
because they are so not looking at their
issues and they are so
minimizing their own wants needs and
feelings that they have convinced
themselves they don't have those things
or that they only have good and healthy
wants needs and feelings
but what the avoidant has is a positive
view of self
negative view of others so they believe
i'm okay everyone else is not okay and
they're gonna cross my boundaries
so the avoidant lives behind this
barricade of walls where they believe
as long as i'm alone as long as i don't
have to form close relationships or
close attachments
i will be okay and the way that they
keep themselves behind this wall is by
finding fault in
absolutely everybody else all of the
time so they have what we can refer to
as an
outer critic so instead of the inner
critic that the anxious and fearful
avoidant types have where they're
constantly finding fault with themselves
the avoidant person is always finding
fault with others and using little flaws
and perceived inadequacies in other
people
as an excuse to not get close to not
share their own needs to not share their
own emotions
and to make themselves continue to feel
justified in not getting close to others
so the avoidant personality might think
they're never in the drama triangle
but they're actually consistently in the
persecutor role they just do it quietly
inside of their own minds
let's say they're in an argument with
their partner they might say nothing
they might leave the room they might
refuse to have the interaction in the
first place
but what's happening inside of their
minds is they are minimizing their
partner's experience minimizing their
own experience
and telling themselves this is stupid
this doesn't matter i'm not even going
to
engage with this this is beneath me i
don't need this in my life
they're activating all of these
avoidance strategies that keep them
from taking other people's or their own
emotions seriously
so they do tend to inherently believe in
their relationship this relationship
will be good and healthy and healed
once my partner changes and that is
probably 50 true because again
the anxious and the avoidant partner
tend to gravitate towards each other
and both of them have attachment wounds
they need to work on right the anxious
style
needs to work on self-sufficiency but
the avoidant style needs to work on
emotional awareness both their own and
other people's
and taking themselves and others
seriously so if you're avoiding you have
an anxious partner
yes things would get better for them if
they healed
but it would not mean that suddenly you
have a good relationship for you to have
a good relationship
you still have to show up you still have
to do the work you still have to make
yourself aware of and
deeply sensitive to your own needs
your own wants your own vulnerabilities
you have to learn to bring those to the
table
you have to learn to share yourself
honestly and you need to learn
to set boundaries i'm going to do a
whole video on this but avoidance tend
to think that they have really strong
boundaries because they're really good
at detaching and what they don't
intuitively understand
is that detaching and having boundaries
are not the same thing
detaching is a trauma response boundary
setting
means being clear about your needs being
clear about your feelings
explaining what the boundaries about and
then living healthily within those
bounds boundaries help you live
interdependently avoidance helps you
live
counter-dependently so what that means
is living in a way
that ensures you will never in any way
rely on another person
feel like another person's actions
affect you and what the avoidant person
does not intuitively
understand is that the secure person who
does attend to their own wants needs and
feelings
and who does engage in healthy
relationships is actually a lot
less vulnerable than the avoidant they
are less vulnerable to hurt because they
have communities and people who can help
them heal from it
they are less vulnerable to betrayal
because they can engage in honest
relationships with other honest people
who are showing up to the table
authentically they are less likely to
get rejected because they don't live
their life in a very neurotic and
strange way
they are able to have authentic
communication with other people
where other people can see their nuanced
whole instead of the avoidant
who doesn't really show themselves to
anyone and then gets confused when
they're not having the healthiest
relationships
so like the anxious style the avoidant
tends to live in the middle of the drama
triangle they are in constant
persecution mode thinking everyone else
is trying to cross my boundaries all the
time
if only everyone else would get their
together this would be fine and the
only way to remove themselves from this
narrative is to move
into the challenger role when you're in
the challenger position
you intuitively accept that your
situation
is changing you that you are dynamically
energetically intertwined with
every person that you talk to every
situation you engage with every new
challenge you take on
the world affects you and you affect the
world and when you're
in challenger mode you take that as a
given and you make choices according to
that
so you cannot tell yourself in a
challenger position
this is entirely someone else's fault
you cannot tell yourself in a challenger
position if my partner would only x y or
z
this would no longer be a problem in a
challenger role you have to accept
i am choosing to be here i'm choosing to
engage in this relationship
i'm choosing to engage in this dynamic
and i'm choosing to learn and grow from
it and be
changed and challenged by it instead of
just deciding that it doesn't matter
because it does matter everything you
are doing in your life every person you
speak to
every situation you enter into it does
change you you can deny that as an
avoidant and you can pretend that you're
completely invulnerable
you are already vulnerable if you are
watching this and you have
any relationship with another human
being you might feel like you've
completely closed yourself off no
you still have feelings about that
they're just coming out unconsciously in
weird neurotic ways
and if you want to step into the
challenger position it means accepting
that you are going to have relationships
with imperfect
people okay so just like the anxiously
attached type has this vision in their
head of a soulmate who's gonna magically
take away all of their anxieties and
problems and challenges in life
the avoidant has a soulmate fantasy of
someone they're gonna meet
who somehow can have a normal
relationship with them while also
staying perfectly regulated
never being unreasonable never asking
for something that the avoidant doesn't
want to give naturally
and who intuitively understands them in
a way that means they don't have to
communicate
or state each other's needs to just get
each other and live in happy harmony
and just like the anxious person's
soulmate fantasy is completely and
totally bogus
so is the avoidance if you want to be in
a partnership as an avoidant
with absolutely no exceptions you must
accept that you will be in a partnership
with an imperfect person
who does things wrong who is irrational
sometimes
who asks for things that it's not
necessarily fair to ask for
and you have to learn how to set clear
boundaries
how to understand what your own emotions
and needs are how to bring those to the
table
and how to engage with the person who is
imperfect in a way that is still
loving and fair and respectful to both
of you
there is not someone out there who is
100 compatible
for you and this is a trap the avoidant
type gets stuck in thinking
a lot of the time they think okay my
partner's doing x y or z so they just
must not be the one
someone is out there for me who's better
and more self-sufficient and more
self-reliable
and you have to let go of the idea that
that person is out there before you can
build a healthy relationship with
anybody you will not find someone who's
100 compatible with you
but the people you're dating are
probably like 20 compatible with you
because you refuse to go for people who
you're truly compatible with
and instead you just kind of sit back
and let people come to you and who comes
to you anxiously attach people who
cannot take care of their own needs
you could meet someone who's like 80
percent compatible with you which is a
crazy
high compatibility score if you're not
expecting perfection
but to meet that person you have to
start showing up
as a human being who can be authentic
and form real relationships with people
okay
so if you want to get out of this cycle
of feeling like you're dating people who
can't take care of themselves and need
you
you have to start being someone who is
able to take relationships seriously and
then you'll start meeting people
who are self-sufficient and can take
care of most of their own wants and
needs
and who probably have a lot in common
with you because you'll start being
attracted to
and know how to form relationships with
secure people
unconsciously avoidance are so afraid of
rejection
that they will almost never pursue the
people they're actually interested in
unless they're very clear that they just
want to hook up with that person and
they don't take it too seriously
but when they meet someone who they
actually want to be with more often than
not avoidance will either
refuse to go for that person or they
will be too afraid to go for that person
or they will
try to pursue that person and have it
not work out because they don't have the
proper attaching strategies to make a
relationship feel normal and
non-neurotic
but if you learn to take yourself your
needs and other people's needs seriously
you could have those healthy
relationships and that would be a
complete and total game changer
for the avoidant type once they've
learned to step into that challenger
role
and accept that they are already
vulnerable anytime they're in
relationship
so you might as well choose a
vulnerability that matters and that gets
you somewhere you want to be
okay fearful avoidance the first thing
to note about this style is that it's
going to use a range of both strategies
that we just talked about so what that
means is that sometimes a fearful
avoidant is going to go into their
activation or anxious strategies and
they're going to try some of that more
controlling behavior to try to draw
their partner in closer
other times they're going to deactivate
and they're going to get really critical
about their partner inside of their
minds and they're going to look for
reasons or excuses to leave a
relationship
to not have to deal with a problem to
minimize their own feelings and other
people's feelings so that the problem
just kind of goes away without it having
to be dealt with and what that means is
that to heal
the fearful avoidance needs to use
strategies from both the anxious and
avoidant type so they need to learn to
become comfortable with themselves
and comfortable alone but they also need
to learn how to show up for themselves
take their own emotions seriously take
other people's emotions seriously
and what they really have to watch out
for in this process is not ricocheting
too far in one direction or the other so
because the fearful avoidance type does
have both of these strategies
there can be this tendency for fearful
avoidance to get into a relationship and
have all of their anxious strategies
activated so for
years at a time they could become
completely enmeshed
have few to no boundaries in
relationships um
feel very very fearful of the
relationship ending or their partner
leaving
especially if they're with a partner
who's a bit more avoidant than they are
but then get out of a relationship and
just go to town on their avoidance
strategies so they might spend years
alone
and feel super happy and super
comfortable as a general rule fearful
avoidance
tend to feel more comfortable out of
relationships than they do in
relationships
because they are able to self-regulate
once their anxious strategies are not
activated so they'll kind of get out of
something that might have been very
chaotic and full on and intense and they
might feel like okay i'm doing the work
on myself i'm figuring out how to be
alone and then when i go back into a
partnership i'll be healthier but what
they're actually doing is just going to
town with their avoidance strategies
and they are minimizing their own
emotions minimizing others emotions
telling themselves they don't need a
partner they don't need closeness they
don't need intimacy
and then the first second that something
happens maybe they get rejected maybe
something gets triggered
that makes them really want comfort and
warmth and closeness and intimacy
and because they didn't develop true
self-soothing strategies they only
developed
avoidance strategies which don't help
you when real hard emotions come along
they'll turn right back to what they
know which is a codependent enmeshed
relationship and they'll get stuck in
this kind of continuous cycle
where they're just ricocheting between
their two strategies rather than
actually doing the healing work that's
necessary to live in the middle ground
so again fearful avoidance have the
world view of i'm not okay you're not
okay so they're very critical about
themselves and they're also very
critical of other people
particularly their intimate partnerships
so something i've seen a lot with
fearful avoidance is that they get stuck
in these relationships where they
believe that they're
tricked into being there in some way
that they don't really want to be there
but they don't know how to leave
because they have that critical view of
self so they need others to soothe the
view of self
but they also have that same critical
view of others that avoidant people do
so instead of idealizing their partner
and feeling like they're excited to be
in their relationship the way you often
see with anxious partnerships
with the fearful avoidant they often
feel like my partner and i are in this
like mutual hostage situation where we
know each other's worst
sides and that's why we can't leave and
that's why i can't get out because i
don't know how to give myself
the love and care that i need in this
moment but i also
have very very critical views of other
people so my partner is someone i don't
necessarily respect
i don't necessarily feel excited by i
don't necessarily feel like i want to
spend my life with
and this is often true no matter which
partnership they end up with because
that mutual sense of intimacy is what
triggers their avoidance response so as
soon as they get the sense of intimacy
from someone that they initially desire
their avoidance strategies kick in and
they go into criticism mode and then
they will feel like they're in this
relationship where they don't understand
why they're staying but they don't know
how to leave
that's not always how it works but as a
general rule that tends to be a pattern
that comes up again and again with
fearful avoidance that gets stuck in
very dysfunctional relationships
and when you look at the history of the
fearful avoidant it makes a lot of sense
because they often grow up in a very
dysregulated home environment so what
that means
is a family dynamic where people were
not encouraged to have their own
boundaries to have their own sense of
self
there was a lot of enmeshment and any of
the insecurely attached types you'll
often see this with
but what happened with the fearful
avoidant was they learned that my needs
will get taken care of
only if someone else's needs are soothed
before mine so what that absolutely sets
them up for is taking on the savior role
in the drama triangle so the fearful
avoidance tends to unconsciously believe
that i will only have my needs met
once i first save someone else from
something difficult or challenging that
they're going through
so the fearful avoidance thinks that
love means being needed and that's often
why they end up in these relationships
that they feel very resentful about
so they're not consciously walking
around going okay who's the most messed
up partner i can find but
they do have a very strong tendency to
gravitate towards people who will need
them in some way so people who
maybe have extreme emotional regulation
problems who have very bad attachment
issues who have substance abuse problems
or something else in their life that
makes them kind of a victim to their own
psychology
and the fearful avoidant will naturally
seek these people out because they have
a negative view of self okay so like the
anxious attachment style fearful
avoidance feels like they're kind of
inherently flawed or broken
and they could only be loved by someone
who is just as inherently flawed and
broken as they are
and remember the savior role in the
drama triangle is not
true savioring it is not true help it's
a creation of a codependent relationship
where both people need each other to
stay regulated and neither one is truly
independent
or truly thriving so the fearful
avoidant will often feel like i'm gonna
help this person but what they're
actually doing is creating a dynamic
where that person needs them to feel
okay
and so the longer the relationship goes
on the worse both people's mental health
and independence and coping abilities
tend to become rather than the better
now the opposite of the savior role in
the drama triangle is the coach position
so the coach intuitively believes i am
okay other people are okay and this is
the absolute opposite of what the
fearful avoidant naturally believes
the coach believes i have the ability to
self-regulate
set boundaries and keep myself okay and
so do
other people so to step into the coach
position as a fearful avoidant
means letting go of this idea that your
partner needs you and won't be okay
without you
it means letting go of this idea that
other people are messes and that you are
a mess
and that love is a mutual hostage
situation
relationships are not supposed to be
about two people keeping each other's
most horrific secrets
relationships are supposed to be about
two people who are whole
individuals coming together and choosing
to support each other
without enmeshment without needing each
other without feeling like
one will absolutely never be okay if the
other one leaves and if you feel like
that's true about your partner as a
fearful avoidant there is like a
99 chance it's true about you you think
you're the one who's not gonna be okay
if someone stops needing you
stepping into coach position means
finally taking responsibility and
acknowledging
that you are playing a very large part
in keeping your relationships
codependent
that when you are out of relationship
you are not truly fulfilling or
self-actualizing
what you're doing is ignoring your own
emotional needs and then
letting this pile of need grow and grow
and grow until it overwhelms you and
forces you back into what you know which
is a codependent relationship
and if you can take responsibility for
the way that you have been
living in these extremes and creating
this
unbelievable chasm of need inside of you
you can start healing it you have to be
willing to look at other people
as autonomous independent and capable of
solving their own problems and for you
that's scary because if other people are
capable of solving their own problems
you kind of feel like well wait what's
my role if i'm not needed
how am i going to get love you're going
to start giving it to yourself
just like the anxious style and if you
didn't watch the anxious style i want
you to rewind the video to the beginning
and watch the advice that's given for
the anxious attachment style stepping
out of the drama triangle
you need to do the same work you need to
start showing up for yourself
re-parenting yourself giving yourself
the love the compassion the closeness
the care
the intimacy that you're constantly
seeking from other people
and you also need to do the avoidant
work of learning to take your own
emotions seriously
take other people's emotions seriously
accepting
that you will be dealing with
unreasonable people but that you can
still choose reasonable responses in
those situations
so the fearful avoidance also has this
kind of soulmate fantasy
where they believe okay my soulmate is
out there but i'm not good enough for
them yet so i'm going to sit here and
kind of quietly develop myself into the
kind of person
that my soul mate would want to be with
that idea has to go out the window
you have to do the work of making
yourself feel okay and good
and whole in or out of a relationship
with or without your soulmate
and you also have to do the work of
bringing your worldview to a place where
you trust rely on and feel like you can
be interdependent with other people
without anyone having to keep anyone's
deep dark secrets
okay so you really have to start
practicing interdependence what does
that mean
it means showing up in friendships more
honestly
so that you don't feel like your
intimate partners or your attachment
figures are the only people who really
know you or who you can really tell your
true self to it means
starting to take terms like self-love
and self-care seriously
instead of laughing them off and
pretending that you're above that kind
of stuff
it means learning to trust that other
people can
take care of themselves and that might
mean bringing some people into your
social circle
who are more secure who are more
self-sufficient who can model for you
that other people are okay when they're
on their own but that that doesn't mean
that people
don't want close happy fulfilling
relationships
one of the most important pieces of work
the fearful avoidant will ever do
is learning to set boundaries within
relationships
they have this tendency to minimize
their own needs like the avoidant
so intensely that they don't even know
what they want or need out of a
relationship they feel extreme
guilt around the fact that they have
needs and then when they get into a
relationship there's this deep form of
enmeshment that happens because all of
their boundaries go out the window
in order for you to be healthy in a
relationship as a fearful avoidant
you have to learn when i'm feeling
something in a relationship it's okay
for me to bring it up address it and set
a boundary
until you can do that you're probably
not ready to be in a serious or healthy
relationship
or if you are that's something that
you're gonna really really need to put
some work into
and in order to set a boundary you have
to operate under the belief
that the other person will be okay if
you set a boundary that they will find a
way to figure out what they need to do
on their own
and that they will be an autonomous
human being and that that will actually
be better for them in the long run than
you enabling them
so codependence anonymous is another
awesome resource for the fearful
avoidant just like the anxious style you
have to start
operating under the assumption that
you're powerless over other people
all you can focus on is your own growth
your own development and your own
relationship with yourself
which will naturally radiate outward
into more positive and more growing
relationships with people around you
so stepping into that coach position
means accepting that you have endless
possibilities and the people around you
also have endless possibilities and you
can choose
to co-create an incredible environment
with people but it has to be both of you
showing up to the table as your whole
selves
and if you don't yet feel like a whole
person that's just a sign that it's time
for you to take some time
focus on yourself learn to set
boundaries with yourself so that you can
do it with other people once you enter
back into relationship
now again with all of these and
everything we just talked about this is
step one okay attachment healing is such
a long road it took you decades to form
these patterns of thought right
so you don't change them overnight you
don't change them in six months you
change them by doing
hard intensive daily work on your own
mindset
that goes on for the rest of your life
but it's so
so possible to make really big changes
along the way if you're just showing up
honestly for yourself
and you're able to catch yourself every
time you're in the drama triangle
and go i'm in the drama triangle right
now i can
choose a different response it starts
there
and we'll talk a lot more about what
comes next soon but that's the beginning
it's just
being aware watching yourself move
through your life and notice
when am i feeling like the answer to my
problem lies outside of myself and that
is always
always the place you need to start and
of course want to remind you that if you
are an enfp or an infp personality type
i run soul bootcamp programs on my
website www.heidiprebe.com
you can go there and check those out and
i will see you next time for more videos
on attachment style personality type or
whatever else you guys
want to talk about here alright love you
all stay regulated
