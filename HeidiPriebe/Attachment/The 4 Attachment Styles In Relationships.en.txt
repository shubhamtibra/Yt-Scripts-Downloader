okay i always know it's
big huge video day when i have a vendy
coffee like i wake up and i just
feel it in my bones i'm like i'm gonna
have to talk a whole ton today
that's how i know i'm gonna create a
monster video so
i guess that is what's coming so this is
a video that people were requesting and
as soon as they requested it i was like
that completely makes sense as the next
video in the attachment style series
which is what each attachment style
looks like in relationships
but actually the real reason i made this
video was because i was taking a bath
last night
and i thought of the best metaphor for
how relationships work for each of the
attachment styles
there are not a lot of things in this
life that are
purely good and not bad on any level
but good metaphors are one of those
things like when a good metaphor arrives
in my brain
i'm like damn this is why i wake up in
the mornings this is
the reason to stay alive when times are
dark is knowing
you will be taking a bath one night
reading a trashy fiction book
and the perfect metaphor for
attachment styles
will just arrive in your brain and sit
there and you will be
morally and spiritually obligated to get
on a video the next morning
and share that metaphor so here it is it
is year 2021 as i'm filming this so
obviously everyone is very very familiar
with the concepts of
illness uh vaccines immune systems
getting sick
these are kind of things that are on our
minds all of the time so we're very
familiar with physical sickness
but being insecurely attached is kind of
like being emotionally sick
so secure people have strong immune
systems emotionally so what that means
is that from a very young age
they kind of had these emotional
safeguards that got put into place
that convinced them that the world is a
safe place that they are
capable of both loving and being loved
without being harmed in any major ways
and that when things get rough they can
lean on other people for support
and those people are going to be there
for them in healthy ways as long as you
know they're finding the right people
and surrounding themselves by the right
people so being securely attached is
kind of like having a really strong
immune system it doesn't mean that
things aren't going to go wrong for you
in life
it definitely doesn't mean that things
won't go wrong for you in relationships
but it means that if things do go wrong
you're able to recover from it at kind
of a normal pace
so you don't have an abnormal either
aversion to
or need for relationships you can
function just fine when you're single
and you can function just fine in a
relationship
i'm always like what do i say about
secures i don't want it to seem like
being securely attached means that life
is a walk in the park
like you're gonna have bad things happen
to you in life you're gonna have bad
experiences in relationships you're
gonna have
trouble meeting and finding someone who
you really deeply connect with and want
to spend your life with
those are very normal human experiences
and you will have
all of those as a securely attached
person but it means that when things do
go wrong
you can recover from things like
breakups and losses and
challenges that you go through in life
because you have this healthy emotional
immune system
unless you get scorned like extremely
dramatically and badly like have a big t
trauma kind of happen there isn't this
inherently flawed view of relationships
themselves it's just that you're
struggling sometimes in the moment
because you're a human being and that
happens to all of us
so insecure people are in relationships
there's a very natural kind of give and
take so they understand that they're
capable of self-soothing and taking care
of a lot of their own problems
but they also know that if they need
something from their partner they can go
to their partner state their need and
they can kind of reasonably expect that
that need will be met because they see
relationships as this place
where it's possible to co-regulate and
to compromise and to figure out a way
that makes everyone happy so
there are a lot of kind of win-win
solutions that naturally exist in the
mind of the securely attached person
and even if their partner can't give
them what they need they're pretty
decent at going okay well i can find a
way to give myself what i need or to
figure out that thing on my own
um and it's nice that maybe my partner
tried to meet me halfway or at least
heard me out whatever so they have a
very rational approach to relationships
much of the time and there will be these
kind of
normal irrationalities that come up so
maybe you and your partner are a bit
different like one's an extrovert and
one's an introvert and you clash on
certain things
but there won't be these kind of giant
fundamental worldview differences in
terms of how you view relationships and
what's acceptable and not acceptable in
a relationship
that come up when you have two secure
people generally unless of course they
come from like totally different
cultures where there's totally different
standards for even what secure
attachment mean so secure people are
often left out of the conversation about
attachment style but they shouldn't be
because we should be modeling our
behavior after secure people so
the more and more we learn about what a
securely attached relationship looks
like
the more we can kind of try to infuse
those tactics into our own relationship
so one thing secure people do really
well is they believe that their own
wants and needs are serious and ought to
be taken seriously but they
also believe their partner's wants and
needs are serious and not to be taken
seriously
so again they have this world view of
i'm okay you're okay so if the secure
person believes i'm okay
and then they have a problem they
believe okay my natural state is okay so
this is a problem that needs to get
dealt with maybe i'll ask for some help
from my partner so i can return to my
normal state of being okay
and then if their partner is having a
problem they're going okay well this
person's normal state is okay it's not
like they're
completely emotionally dysregulated most
of the time so this must be a very real
problem that they're dealing with
maybe i can help them or lend them some
support as they work through it so they
can return to their natural state of
being okay
so that's the i'm okay you're okay world
view that the securely attached person
has
so they don't have to freak out when
they have a need or when someone else
has a need because they understand that
most of the time everyone's okay and
they're just kind of little upsets to
the equilibrium that come along that
need to be dealt with where you don't
have that same world view of i'm okay
you're okay is when you have
absolutely any other attachment style so
we're gonna talk next about anxiously
attached people so anxiously touched
people
tend to be the most invested in
relationships the most consistently in
relationships they might be
either serial monogamists or people who
spend a lot of time thinking about
relationships
so a lot of the time we call anxious
people anxious preoccupied types because
they are quite literally preoccupied
with thoughts about relationships and
the anxious person's worldview is i'm
not okay
you're okay and this lands them in a lot
of trouble in a lot of relationships
why so the anxiously attached person is
like someone who has a compromised
emotional immune system
so early on unlike the secure person
they did not
learn that everything's going to be okay
and the world is a reliable place and
that they have all of the strength they
need to get through the challenges of
their lives
they learned early on i don't have the
strength i need to get through the
challenges in my life
i need someone else to help me out and
that if i'm left alone i will not be
okay so that is a compromised emotional
immune system it doesn't function the
way it should
but there's a medicine that feels like
it works really really
well for insecurely attached people and
that medicine
is love now everyone needs love secure
people
absolutely need love but they kind of
already have it flowing through them all
of the time because they tend to have
built up very healthy support systems
around themselves so they'll have very
emotionally vulnerable and open and
close friendships and family
relationships and
things like that so love is always kind
of a little bit accessible to people who
are securely attached unless of course
they're going through something in their
life that makes them more isolated
for a period of time or whatever it is
but generally they have the tools they
need to go
seek out more love and more friendship
in perfectly appropriate amounts when
they need to
now when someone is anxiously attached
they feel this kind of overwhelming
desperation for love a lot of the time
why because their emotional immune
system is compromised
so unlike the secure person who knows
how to self soothe and make themselves
feel
okay when they're going through
challenging times the anxiously attached
person doesn't know how to regulate
their own emotions properly so
every time something goes wrong whether
it's an upset in the workplace whether
it's you know maybe a major loss in
their life so
very real problems that they're facing
their unconscious mind automatically
goes you need to find someone who can
help
regulate you through these challenges so
love literally feels like
nyquil to them so it allows them to
function in a way that they're not used
to functioning by themselves so what
does this look like in relationships
remember that the anxiously attached
person has the world view if i'm not
okay you're okay they have
negative view of self positive view of
others so they believe i can't take care
of myself but someone else can take care
of me
so what happens when they meet someone
they like the first thing that's very
unique to anxiously attached types or at
least very prevalent and anxiously
attached types
is that they have trouble distinguishing
between attraction
and feelings in the mind of the
anxiously attached person those things
are kind of one and the same
so for any other attachment style
sometimes not the case for fearful
avoidant but we'll get to that later
they see attraction as kind of a yellow
light like it's a proceed with caution
so if you're attracted to someone that
might be the first indication that this
is someone you should get to know better
and kind of see whether or not you want
to pursue a relationship with them
but for the anxiously attached person
they're like as soon as i'm attracted to
someone that's kind of all of the
information i need to feel like i should
want to be with this person but what's
really interesting is that the anxiously
attached person
isn't actually trying to get to know the
person in the same way that other people
are when they're getting to know them
they're more looking at the person and
going okay what qualities does this
person have that i feel are lacking in
myself
so anxiously attached people have a very
negative or critical view of themselves
so they might kind of go okay well maybe
this person is really outgoing or maybe
they're really charming or maybe they're
really confident and those are traits i
don't have
and unconsciously they believe i'm never
going to have those traits but
if i can get someone who has all of
those traits to love me
then i will become worthy through the
process of them loving me
so anxiously attached people are kind of
always on the hustle for worthiness i
think that that's actually a
brene brown phrase she talks about like
hustling for worthiness and this is
something that anxiously attached people
tend to be very very
intimately acquainted with so they think
that they are as worthy
as they are loved by someone who's kind
of impressive or cool or interesting in
some way so anxiously attached people
have this kind of interesting paradox to
them where they might be really
interested in self-improvement
and kind of gaining all of these skills
that make them seem very attractive to
others
but what they're trying to do is not
actually become self-sufficient
but build themselves into the kind of
person who a self-sufficient person
would love
and so then all of a sudden they can
relax and kind of finally have their
needs taken care of so it's this really
interesting paradox that feels very
logical in the mind of an anxiously
attached person so what you'll often see
in the early stages with anxiously
attached people
is that they really really want to lock
things down they want to get to the
point where this other person is
committed to them
so they can feel that sense of security
so they can feel like okay
it's time to relax and know that my
needs will be met because again
love is medicine so they see other
people as pharmacists and they're like i
need
to put myself in a position where this
person can give me all of the medicine i
need at
absolutely any point in time and i know
that every time i go to them i will have
that medicine given to me
and because they have that emotionally
compromised immune system they need a
lot of medicine so
early on they're automatically starting
to think of strategies for like getting
more and more love and medicine from
this person
so the question that the anxious person
is kind of always asking themselves
during the dating phase of a
relationship
is does this person like me yet am i
acceptable enough to them yet how do i
get them
to like me to commit to me to give me a
sense of security
but they're almost never thinking do i
like this person does this person fit
with my life do i see my future lining
up with this person in a meaningful way
because they're so focused on getting
that sense of validation and worthiness
that they forget that there are these
very tangible things that need to be
considered in the relationship they kind
of feel like okay i should take whatever
i can get if i can get this person who i
find very attractive to like me
i'll just figure out the rest later so
what often happens there is the
anxiously attached person will be like
okay
i've locked this person down now we can
figure out the rest and then they
realize like oh
our futures don't actually align or they
want these things that i'm actually
really uncomfortable with or that don't
necessarily work for me
and so then all of these protest
behaviors will start picking up so
they'll start
picking fights or they'll start being
manipulative in some way to try to get
their partner to kind of conform to what
they want
and the reason that all of this happens
at this phase is because the anxiously
attached person right from the beginning
didn't sit down and consider does the
things that this person want
actually fit with the things i want they
just thought how do i make myself worthy
enough to get love from this person
and they figured everything else was
something they could figure out later
but then when it comes time to figure it
out
there are often a lot of conflicts that
come up so that can be a very stormy
phase
of the relationship for anxiously
attached people is the phase where they
actually have to start figuring out okay
what does our future together look like
and all of these conflicts can come up
where their partner can also feel a
little bit duped because the anxiously
attached person is kind of a yes man at
the beginning of the relationship
they have this kind of idealized version
of their partner so they're like i'll
just say yes and go along with whatever
and then once they start realizing the
reality of their partner and realizing
where they're not aligned with their
partner
it can lead to a lot of emotional upset
and turmoil and stress for the anxiously
attached person so once they're in a
relationship
the anxiously attached person tends to
want a lot of communication almost kind
of frequent communication because again
any little upset that comes up they feel
like they need love they need that dose
of medicine to make themselves feel
okay again so when their partners start
to pull away in any capacity and often
this happens because anxiously attached
people tend to be drawn to dismiss of
avoidant people
there can be this almost overwhelming
feeling of stress for the anxiously
attached person
because they feel like okay i need this
constant communication but this person
isn't giving it to me
and so they'll start to create stories
in their head about why that's happening
and they'll figure okay
this person is pulling away because they
don't love me because they don't want to
be with me because they're cheating
because something really sinister is
going on right so they tend to give
a lot of meaning and put a lot of
emphasis on their partner taking space
when it could be that their partner's
taking space for perfectly healthy
reasons especially once you're kind of
past the honeymoon phase of the
relationship
it's really normal for people to settle
into routines together and have their
own independent lives
and the anxiously attached person
doesn't always understand why that's
happening so that kind of intense
full-on honeymoon phase that a lot of
relationships go through the anxiously
attached person wants that to last
forever
and they don't understand why it doesn't
last forever because that's what they
really like they really like that
initial intensity
and they can be like this even in
friendships in relationships with
authority figures in
different relationships the anxiously
attached person can mistake
that initial bout of intensity for
something that's going to last forever
and then get very confused and want a
lot a lot a lot of communication
in a way that maybe the other person
isn't 100 comfortable with so that's the
thing to watch out for as an anxiously
attached person is just
believing that space means something
sinister as opposed to realizing that
it's very normal for people to lead
independent lives and then kind of come
together and go apart
a little bit as the flow of their life
just goes on so in any partnership it's
very normal to be closer for a period of
time and then less close for a period of
time and to kind of have that cycle but
with the baseline being like
fairly connected and fairly on the same
page but when they're going through
these phases of feeling like there's not
enough connection the anxious person
will kind of reach out again and again
again try to get these bids for
attention whether that is
smothering their partner with love and
just sending them a ton of texts and a
ton of phone calls and
showing up at their house or it can be
instigating fights or arguments so that
at least they're getting focused
attention from their partner but the
anxious person will often feel kind of
victimized in this phase and they'll
feel like
i just give too much i just love too
much and there can be this almost like
murder complex that comes in for the
anxiously attached person but in reality
what they're usually doing is not
listening to their partner's needs which
are the need for boundaries the need for
space
so you're not giving your partner the
thing that they need if you're kind of
love bombing them against their will
you're giving them something they don't
want which is an overabundance of
attention
so the anxiously attached person their
kind of root to growth in relationships
often is to learn to self-soothe so to
learn to not go to their partner for
every single thing that feels wrong
but to develop some of their own coping
mechanisms for when life gets a little
bit difficult or tricky
so that they can soothe themselves and
give their partner the appropriate
amount of space that they need but with
any attachment style it's really hard to
recognize that other people have
different needs than you that's just
kind of inherent to the human condition
we have to be very conscious about
realizing that what works for us doesn't
work for everyone
so the anxiously attached person because
they are so preoccupied with getting
love
they kind of assume that it's that way
for everyone so if someone's pulling
away or taking space
the anxious preoccupied person tends to
go well if i were pulling away or taking
space
it would be because i was trying to kind
of punish my partner and get them to
come closer
so often when they see their partners
pulling away or taking space they're
like oh
this person needs love like that light
bulb just goes off in their brain really
intensely really fast because they think
in that situation
i would need love so they go and
approach their partners full force and
try to give them all this love that
maybe their partner doesn't actually
want or need maybe they're genuinely
trying to take some space so
that projection can be something to
watch out for as
anxious types because if you don't watch
out for that you're going to feel
perpetually victimized perpetually as if
you are giving and not getting anything
in return
and you're never really going to realize
that you're not giving the right things
you're not getting the right things and
you're not using healthy or assertive
communication strategies
you're really doing something that's a
little bit manipulative because you're
trying to get love by giving it instead
of just giving it for the sake of giving
it
but again it takes a bit of time to
become conscious of all of this so don't
beat yourself up too hard if you're
sitting there cringing and being like oh
i do that no
um it's very normal to not understand
why you're doing that
and to have it feel like it's coming
from a very good place and not
recognizing that what you're doing is
projecting so if this is the first time
you're realizing it
go easy on yourself it's cool now you
know now you can become more conscious
of it and hopefully that just leads you
to a healthier place in your
relationships in the future now let's
talk about dismissive avoidant
so dismissive avoidance the much beloved
partner of the anxious attachment a lot
of the time once again
these types anxious preoccupied and
dismissive avoidant often end up
together why because the anxious
preoccupied pursues pursues pursues
the dismissive avoidant withdrawals
withdrawals withdrawals and they get
stuck in this death cycle that we're
going to have a slew of videos on
later on in this series so the
dismissive avoidant has a positive view
of self
negative view of others so they believe
that they're okay within the walls of
their own boundaries but other people
need from them and are going to try to
take from them but the interesting thing
about the dismissive avoidant is that
they are not okay so
they have a compromised immune system
the same way the anxiously attached
person does
so they did not at a young age the way
the secure person did
receive an abundance of love and care
and attention that makes them feel like
okay
my needs will be met in the world i will
be okay when i go through difficult
periods of time i can reach out and get
help and feel okay
and interdependent and connected so the
dismissive avoidant has a compromised
immune system
but they are allergic to the medicine of
love
so they do need love every human being
needs love so what that means is that
they can take the medicine in small
doses
but if they take it in really large
doses they have really bad reactions to
it that they need to go
be alone to deal with so what you'll
find the dismissive avoidant doing
rather than chasing the medicine of love
like the anxiously attached person will
do
is they find painkillers so they're
chronically ill because they have this
compromised immune system
and they can't take the medicine that
makes them at least superficially better
but they can find things that make it so
they don't notice they're sick so i
think it was actually on youtube the
other day
this commercial came up for advil where
it was like people
like playing tennis or whatever it was
they were doing they had like strained
muscles and then they took an advil and
felt better and then the catch line was
like
pain says you can't advil says you can
and i was like wow
what a horrific message to be sending
out
because pain itself is not the problem
when we're sick right
pain is the indicator that points to the
problem so if your arm is in
pain the problem is not the pain the
problem is probably that you sprained
your arm
and if you don't lay off it it's gonna
heal wrong so this idea
of just do the things that you shouldn't
be able to do because advil makes you
forget that there's problems in your
body
is so destructive because it's like okay
now you're gonna go over exert yourself
and cause real problems in your body
because you've numbed yourself out
to the indicator lights in your body
that are telling you to stop and this is
exactly how it works for the dismissive
avoidance so
they have emotional problems come up
they have the regular upsets of life
because they don't have a strong immune
system they can't deal with it as
effectively as secure people
so they learn to take a whole bunch of
painkillers so that they don't feel the
pain of everyday life so what are those
painkillers those pain killers can be
things
like throwing themselves into work and
neglecting their emotional life it can
be things like
drinking or using drugs or numbing
themselves out with food
it can be any sort of addictive behavior
as small as compulsively reading a bunch
of books and escaping into fantasylands
or as strong as genuine addictions to
substances but from a very young age
they learned
all of these strategies for just numbing
out the pain so they don't know that
anything's going on with them and they
can't really feel it
and in small doses they will take this
medicine that is love
but they've learned they can only manage
a little bit of it at a time so they
have to space out when they take it
they can't take too much at once and if
they do take too much at once then they
need to withdraw
to manage the negative effects because
again avoidant attachment
means that you are triggered by intimacy
so when you get too close in a
relationship
all of these alarm and panic bells go
off in your brain because when you were
young
you learned that intimacy means your
boundaries are about to be violated and
you're about to have to give more than
you have
and so as soon as that intimacy arises
it's kind of like taking a little bit of
medicine that gives you an allergic
reaction you have to get away so
avoidance we will often see waiting
very slowly into relationships so
they'll kind of take a little bit of
that medicine so to speak so they'll
kind of
interact with someone for a little while
get to know them a little bit and then
take some space
and then go back take a little more
interact a little more and then retreat
and there'll be this kind of process of
moving closer than kind of taking space
then maybe moving a little bit closer
letting someone in again a little bit
and then taking more space and that will
repeat over the course of often years
for an avoidance so avoidance take the
longest time to get into a relationship
they want that dating phase where you're
kind of getting to know someone to
stretch on for a
really long time and another reason why
they're doing this
is because they have that positive view
of self negative view of others
so what they're doing in the dating
phase is measuring up the other person
and going okay
where does this person fit with my life
will they fit in this category will they
fit in this category will they fit in
this category
and they're unconsciously actually
putting this person through almost like
a series of little tiny tests where
they're like okay
i'm going to observe them in this
situation see how they fit then i'm
going to observe them in this situation
see where they fit
then i'm going to put really intense
boundaries up and notice whether or not
that person respects them
and over a period of years they will
eventually decide
this person mostly fits or they mostly
don't but it's a very logical process
like
it's not emotion driven the same way it
is for other types there will be
emotions there like avoidantly attached
people are not devoid of emotions
but they have a much more rational
approach to falling in love and it's
much more about who fits with them
than it is about how they feel about the
other person and the reason that's the
case is because
they're always on some form of
painkiller so
they are numbed out from their own
emotions avoidantly attached people
absolutely feel emotions but they do not
feel them with the same degree of
intensity and force that other people
feel them so they tend to feel most
happy
if they feel like they've found a
partner who really fits into a lot of
different areas of their life and who
won't cause kind of major issues
and a major issue for an avoidantly
attached person would look like someone
who continuously violates their
boundaries
avoidably attached people are really
strict about their boundaries why
because what's inside their boundaries
their ability to keep themselves feeling
safe and okay so if they meet someone
who's constantly trying to like shove
medicine in their mouth as the anxiously
attached people often will with the
avoidantly attached people because they
don't understand that the avoidantly
attached person is allergic to medicine
the avoidantly attached person will be
like whoa whoa
you need to stop that i'm allergic to
this i can't take it
i need to set up boundaries that make
sure you stay outside of them
so that you're not trying to force feed
me something that makes me become
dysregulated and not okay because again
intimacy closeness
love between people makes the avoidantly
attached person have
the equivalent of an allergic reaction
emotionally the very very common pattern
for avoidantly attached people is that
as soon as someone wants the
relationship to go faster than they feel
like they're comfortable with they will
cut that relationship off
and then if the person kind of sticks
around on the peripheries
and shows them okay i'm willing to
continue to give a little bit but not
more than you feel comfortable taking
then the avoidant will be like okay
we'll think again about reintegrating
this person into my life and see if this
time they can respect my boundaries but
again the avoidant is not necessarily
conscious of the fact that they're doing
this they might be but on a conscious
level they're mostly just feeling like
okay i'm not opposed to a relationship
let's say
but i have to find a partner who
respects my boundaries who fits with my
life and who doesn't have any of these
very giant and very apparent flaws
because they have that negative view of
others the avoidantly attached person
can be very critical of people so in
their minds not necessarily to their
face
they'll be kind of looking at how people
behave and thinking about how does this
person
speak to other people what do they like
what are their hobbies what are their
interests how much money do they make
what are these kind of things that
define them
and do i like or dislike those things do
i respect or not respect those things so
again
early on they got really used to
boundary violations in their lives so
they learned
love means people taking things from you
so they're often measuring other people
up
for like how much are they gonna take
from me are they gonna expect things
that are unrealistic of me
um do they have any kind of flaws and so
traction may actually not be as strong a
factor for avoidant types as a lot of
other issues are
so attraction is part of what they
factor into relationships but it's very
very very far from the full thing
it's kind of one of maybe 10 to 20
things they're considering when they're
looking at what kind of partner is going
to fit well with their life so again
this can be the beginning of a really
unhealthy dynamic where you have an
anxious person who's going
i'll be whoever you want me to be if you
just consider me worthy and then the
avoidant person going okay i'll accept
you and date you if i consider you
worthy
so then there's this kind of person
who's just aiming to please the avoidant
and the avoidant who's trying to kind of
keep them at arm's length because they
feel allergic
to this thing that the anxious person's
trying to give them and it becomes this
dynamic that goes on for a long time
is very unhealthy and toxic and doesn't
end
until there's some conscious awareness
brought to the dynamic and both people
are realizing what's happening and what
they're doing wrong
now what's very ironic is that when you
get an anxious and avoidant person in a
relationship the anxious person will
often feel like i'm just giving and
giving and giving and i'm not being
appreciated
because again they're giving something
that the avoidant person doesn't want
because the avoiding person is allergic
to it
but the avoidant on the other hand
because they feel so comfortable meeting
their own needs and finding ways to make
themselves okay when things go wrong in
life
they feel like they're having a very
one-sided relationship with the other
person
because the anxiously attached person is
always asking the avoidant person to
kind of help them deal with these
emotional upsets
but the avoidant person is very good at
keeping themselves level and okay
at least on the surface through life's
emotional upsets so they often feel like
i'm over here managing my own stuff and
i'm also expected to attend to all of
your emotional crises and problems as
they arise
so the avoidantly attached person will
also feel unappreciated in the
relationship a lot of the time
because they'll feel like oh i'm doing
my duty of keeping myself emotionally
okay
but you are not doing your duty of
keeping yourself emotionally okay so
this is a very one-sided relationship
so usually in anxious avoidant dynamics
both partners
feel like they are giving it their all
and the other person is not giving the
right amount or they're giving the wrong
thing or they're not taking
responsibility for their part of the
relationship so just like the anxious
person's path to growth in relationships
is to learn to take more responsibility
for caring for themselves the avoidant
person's path to growth in relationships
is to learn to start seeing other people
as okay so the avoidant person already
thinks they're okay so they tend to have
at least an
okay sense of self-regard but they
assume that other people are going to
take from them
and so they often are very quick to
assume that other people's needs are not
valid avoidant people don't know that
needs can be shared and worked on
together
so they tend to see any need someone
comes to them with as inappropriate
as crossing their boundaries as
something that that person should be
dealing with on their own
so a lot of the growth work in
relationships for avoidant types lies in
learning to recognize that a
they have needs that they could be
bringing to their partner and b
it's okay that their partner is bringing
their needs to them so the avoidant just
like the anxious person has to learn to
get to a place of i'm okay you're okay
instead of assuming that other people's
needs are always
excessive which is what the avoidant
type tends to naturally assume that
anytime someone is coming to someone
else with a need
it's excessive they should be dealing
with it on their own but a healthy and
healed avoidant type will realize that
there
are things that it's perfectly okay to
share in a relationship and once they
stop taking all of their painkillers
and they become sensitized to their own
needs which are very much there under
the surface
then they learn oh i can take these
needs to my partner
and we can work on them together and
they start to develop a healthy
interdependence where they can recognize
yes i can deal with 90 of my own needs
but 10
of them are actually relationship issues
that maybe i need to take to my partner
and we can both put things on the table
and have them dealt with and that's what
a healed avoidant attachment looks like
but with any attachment style it takes a
lot of work to get to that healed place
now let's talk about fearful avoidant so
fearful avoidant once again has the
double whammy of
i'm not okay you're not okay as their
worldview so they believe that they are
bad flawed unlovable but also that other
people are bad flawed and unlovable so
there is kind of no safe place
in the mind of the fearful avoidant type
and this is absolutely every bit as
stormy as it sounds when it comes to the
way that their relationship dynamics
play out in fact i'm going to take that
back
it's probably about a thousand times
more stormy than it sounds i think
people
very severely underestimate just how
unhealthy relationships tend to be for
the fearful avoidant type
and i want to make it clear that i say
that without judgment
so if you are fearful avoidant it is
absolutely
not your fault that this is the way your
mind is wired it happened
very young and it was a very real trauma
response to whatever was happening for
you as a child
you learn to both devalue the self and
devalue other people
and so that puts you in this perpetual
kind of no man's land of
i can't trust myself or rely on myself
but i also can't trust to rely on other
people
and it is psychological hell so it is
not your fault that your relationships
are as stormy
and as difficult as they are but it is
your responsibility if you want to start
having healthy relationships and if you
don't want to perpetuate that cycle of
abuse that has probably
bred you into the person that you are it
is your responsibility to start gaining
some conscious awareness around why
you're doing what you're doing in
relationships
and to find healthier ways to cope and
the exact same is true for any of the
insecurely attached styles but fearful
avoidance does by virtue of its
attachment style have more work to do it
has literally twice the amount of work
to earn security as either the anxious
or the avoidant person does
because each of those styles only have
to change one of their world view so the
anxious person has to build up their
self-confidence so that they feel as
trustworthy and lovable and worthy as
other people and then the avoidant
person has to heal the thoughts that
they have around other people so they
have to start seeing other people
as trustworthy and reliable and lovable
and worthy just like they see themselves
but the fearful avoidance has to heal
both their relationship with themselves
and their relationship with other people
so it's a very long process
but it's totally 100 possible and we'll
talk again about what healing all of
these attachment styles look like in
future videos
but for now we're going to talk about
how the attachment dynamic plays out
for the fearful avoidant in
relationships and uh
buckle your seat belts for this one so
the fearful avoidant has a compromised
immune system they have a severely
compromised immune system
so what that means is that when upsets
happen for them in life or when they go
through challenges
they really really need love like the
anxiously attached person does as a
medicine to help them through those
things because their immune system is
not
strong enough to fight off those things
on their own however
like the avoidantly attached person the
fearful avoidant person is allergic to
love
so intimacy is extremely triggering for
the fearful avoidant when they
feel like they're in a close connected
warm loving relationship
it sets off all of these alarm bells in
their brains and they start to panic and
want out
however unlike the avoidant type advil
doesn't work for them
or it doesn't comprehensively work for
them so for the avoidant for the most
part they can sustain themselves by just
taking a bunch of painkillers
the fearful avoidance can take pain
colors for a while and then they start
feeling like oh i really need it i
really need the medicine i really need
that like fix or that hit of love
but they are so allergic to love so
they'll go
take a hit get really sick and then have
no idea what to do and this is often
what happens in the fearful avoidant
relationships so the anxious and the
fearful avoidant have this shared trait
of seeing love almost like crack like
it's like a fix for them like they want
to go get their hit of love so the
fearful avoidance will go in they'll get
their hit of love and then they'll have
this
violent and vile reaction to it because
they are allergic
to intimacy the same way the avoidant is
but the problem is for the fearful
avoidance that they also know
this medicine they're having such a vile
reaction to is
necessary to sustain them and keep them
alive so they keep
taking this medicine and keep having
this violent reaction and what does that
violent reaction look like
so like the anxious style the fearful
avoidant kind of looks at other people
as pharmacists so their partner is a
pharmacist who's giving them this drug
but this drug is making them sick so you
will often see the fearful avoidance get
into a relationship
start taking all of their medicine from
their partner so taking all of the love
all of the care all of the attention
having a violent reaction then looking
at the partner and go you are making me
sick
so the fearful avoidant projects that
intense reaction that they're having on
to their partner
oh me i'm supposed to be at a
dentist appointment right now oh well
i'll reschedule i'm doing something very
important so the fearful avoidant having
that disdain for the self they have that
same experience that the anxious person
has of having to hustle for worthiness
and they always kind of feel like okay
if i can get a partner who loves me then
it proves my own worthiness but they
also have a negative view of others the
same as the avoidant person so they tend
to get into relationships
where they have really really harsh
judgments about their partner they might
even put down their partner or judge
their partner's choices really heavily
but they feel like they can't leave the
relationship so the fearful avoidant is
the most likely type to feel like they
are stuck
in a relationship with someone they hate
because this person is giving them this
medicine that they are allergic to
and their brains can't compute that the
person is doing that innocently
so often the fearful avoidant will think
oh this love that they're giving me they
must have given me like the wrong
cocktail of medicine so to speak if i'm
having such a violent reaction to it
because i know i need it
but then for some reason when i get it
it doesn't feel right so it must be this
other person's fault
so the fearful avoidant will project all
of these feelings of their own
kind of illness if you will onto their
partner and assume that the partner is
causing it when really
the partner is just trying to give them
whatever it is that they need
and the fearful avoidant doesn't
understand that it's intimacy and love
and healthy things that they're actually
allergic to so this sometimes means that
the fearful avoidant is very emotionally
abusive towards partners in
relationships
it doesn't necessarily mean that but of
all the types fearful avoidance is the
most likely to be an emotionally abusive
partner because they project that
feeling of something's wrong with me i
don't know what but i know it's coming
from you
on to their partner however they are
also the most likely to choose partners
who are
in some way deeply emotionally
dysregulated or kind of messed up
themselves and the reason that happens
is because the fearful avoidance grew up
in a very stormy environment whatever
was going on for them at a young age
was very very intense and kind of
difficult to predict and regulate so
they tend to go after partners who are
also very emotionally stormy and
unpredictable
and they can get into these
relationships that are very much abusive
on both sides
and you'll very frequently see that with
people who are fearful avoidant they'll
get into relationships with other
unhealthy people
because they think they don't deserve a
relationship with a healthy person
because they have a negative view of
self
and then they'll get in and see all the
partners dysfunction judge them for it
really heavily
but still need them and resent the fact
that they feel like they need their
partner
and so they will just start all of these
conflicts where they're trying to
control their partner get their partner
to change get their partner to give them
a different sort of love because they
think oh if they'll just do something
differently then everything would be
fine not realizing
that the work needs to start with them
if you are fearful avoidant
you will never find a partner that will
make you feel the way you want to feel
because you have a negative view of
others so even if
you pursue someone who you think is the
perfect person you put them on a
pedestal the way an anxious person does
the second you settle into that happy
and comfortable relationship
if you truly are fearful avoidant and
not anxiously attached misdiagnosing
yourself as fearful avoidant as soon as
things get good
you will start to feel disdain for your
partner and you will start to judge your
partner and you will start to find fault
with your partner
and you will grow resentful for what you
perceive
as your partner trapping you in this
relationship when in reality you're
there because you feel this desperate
need to be there
even though you hate it there so there's
not really two ways about it
it is hell to be fearful avoidant it's
just hell
um we can put a positive spin on it we
can talk about the positive traits of
fearful avoidance they tend to be very
emotionally aware they tend to be
extremely hyper vigilance they're really
good at understanding other people
they take a really intense interest in
like human psychology and what makes
people tick
and again all of that is a survival
strategy but for the most part
these people have an incredibly
difficult time being in healthy
relationships
whereas let's say the anxious person can
get with a secure person
and heal within that relationship
because the more they learn like oh my
needs will be met
the more they can kind of relax and not
need to over assert their needs
and the avoidant person can feel pretty
healthy if they're out of relationships
or they can even learn to kind of become
less allergic to the medicine
through a process that we'll talk about
uh in another video the fearful
avoidance has to work on both of those
things and it is possible
but usually it means being alone for a
long period of time for them
fearful avoidance tend to feel most
comfortable out of relationships so when
they get into it there's all of this
emotional chaos that happens right
because of that projection and that need
but that disdain for the other person
and then they might get out of it and be
like oh now i feel calm and so you will
see a lot of resistance
into getting into relationships for the
fearful avoidance similar to the
dismissive avoidant
but the difference is that the fearful
avoidant will resist resist resist but
then
once they get into a relationship they
will go 200
in so the dismissive avoidance will kind
of resist resist resist and then even
when they're in the relationship they'll
kind of continue to resist resist resist
and keep their
boundaries very clear forever fearful
avoidance will kind of resist resist
resist resist
try to keep their boundaries intact keep
their boundaries intact keep their
boundaries intact then as soon as
they're committed
they will allow their boundaries to just
drop off a cliff and they will suddenly
just completely and totally give their
partner
everything they need because they don't
know that there's another option in
relationships
they think they have to completely
abandon their sense of self and they
will forget
that they are able to set boundaries so
they'll think in their head okay i can
have my boundaries back when i leave
this relationship but they also kind of
feel like they're hooked on it so being
a fearful avoidant
literally feels in the brain like being
a drug addict it feels like i know this
is bad for me when they're in an
unhealthy relationship
i know i shouldn't be doing this i know
i shouldn't be pursuing this
but i literally cannot quit because i am
hooked on another person and they kind
of know okay i can go get sober and
it'll feel good and they often do so
they'll leave relationships they'll go
like get emotionally sober
not feel like they're getting this fixed
from the other person but then
after a long period of time they'll be
like okay i can engage with this drug
casually again right
i can have a relaxed relationship or i
can build a relationship healthily with
someone and then they get really
addicted again it's this whole cycle
so until they learn why that's happening
and why they feel both such a need for
love and a disdain for love and how to
break those cycles and interrupt those
patterns in their mind
they will forever be kind of a love
junkie and in that same vein
the anxiously attached person will also
relate to the feeling of being a love
junkie but they're not allergic to the
love right so it's like they might
frantically want it frantically want it
frantically on it but they're not having
negative reactions to getting it they're
feeling like oh this drug feels good and
clean every time as opposed to the
fearful avoidant
who's like oh i'm getting weird like
heart palpitations and i'm worried i'm
about to have a heart attack or overdose
like they're in the really
bad stages of drug addiction or love
addiction if you will
and interestingly with both fearful
avoidant and avoidant there can also be
a lot of substance abuse issues because
one way of kind of numbing things out
the way that the avoidant does
will be turning to like drugs or alcohol
a lot of the time for a fearful avoidant
if they feel like oh
anything is healthier than using love is
my fix because love feels so bad but i
know i need
self-regulation so badly so they can
turn to things like drugs or alcohol or
like excessive eating or whatever it is
to numb out these feelings of pain that
they're having without having to go to
another person so what is the path to
growth for the fearful avoidant so again
the fearful avoidance has that double
whammy of needing to heal their
relationship with self and needing to
heal their relationship with others
so often it's a little bit easier i
think in the long run to start with the
relationship to self
and there's a lot of work you can do on
making yourself feel worthy okay
build your distress tolerance up and get
through these major upsets in your life
without
needing to take this medicine that makes
you sick and then once you're doing that
once you're feeling a little bit
stronger and more self-sufficient you
can start working on being
interdependent
and learning that you can bring up your
needs you can set boundaries in
relationships you can have your needs
acknowledged and seen
and respected by other people because
again the avoidant type doesn't know
that that's an option so
fearful avoidant and healing the fearful
avoidant type is
going to be if not its own video a 10
part video series because there's just
so much to
deal with when it comes to the fearful
avoidant the same is true for the
anxious or the avoidant type but the
fearful avoidance quite literally has
double the amount of attachment wounds
than the other two insecurely attached
types so it does take more work to heal
but
again totally possible there are healing
things we can do for
all of these attachment styles i've been
working really really intensively on
healing my own in the past six months
and i can personally attest to how
differently relationships with other
people and with yourself start to feel
when you start doing this work it takes
a long time i'm nowhere near the finish
line
but it is so worth doing because it only
gets better as you go but that's kind of
a brief overview of what relationships
look like for each of these attachment
styles when they're unconscious so again
in the future we're going to look at
unconscious versus conscious expressions
of these attachment styles and what that
means
is how you're operating when you're not
really aware of what's going on for you
psychologically in any of these type
expressions versus what happens when you
are aware of what's going on for you
psychologically and you can start to
catch yourself
recognize your triggers and work with
those in a healthy way but for today
one venti coffee later we are done i
am gonna go to the dentist but if you
guys have questions or comments
please leave them below i'm really
curious about what this video kind of
um helped you clear up or what you still
have questions about and where you're at
in the process of your own attachment
work
so leave them below and i will get back
to you as soon as i can
alright have an awesome weekend
