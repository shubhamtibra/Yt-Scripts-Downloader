hey guys i just wanted to pop on quickly
tonight in my
standing kitchen set because i couldn't
be bothered to make a real one
um to clear up something that i'm seeing
there be some confusion over
in the past 24 hours since we've been
talking about attachment styles
so with any system when you come to the
system there's going to be some words
that mean a very specific thing or have
a working definition within that system
that have a very different definition
outside of the system so an example of
this
is in myers-briggs the word intuitive
means something very different than the
word intuitive
usually means in pop culture so in pop
culture the word intuitive is kind of
like
being a clairvoyant or having a sixth
sense of some sort
but in the myers-briggs system the word
intuitive means something completely
different
and there's actually a very similar
thing going on with attachment styles so
in the attachment style system
the word avoidant is not the same as the
term avoidant that we think of
outside of the attachment style system
so i'm seeing a lot of people
look at the video i made last night or
just talk about attachment styles in
general
and go oh i avoid people so i must have
avoidance somewhere in my type
but the word avoidant in the attachment
style system means something very
specific and it's not the normal term
for avoidance so the normal term for
avoidance just literally means
we're avoiding something so any
attachment style
will avoid people for specific reasons
so secure people
often avoid insecurely attached people
because there's so much drama to
insecurely attach people
and the secure person just doesn't
understand what the drama is about so
they'll often avoid
relationships with insecurely attached
people so i'm seeing a lot of people
going well wait a minute like i feel
avoidant around anxious people and
anxious around avoiding people so i must
be fearful avoidant
that could very well mean that you're
secure it's very normal
to feel avoidant of any situation where
you're getting smothered
and to feel anxious in any situation
where you're genuinely being threatened
in some way like your partner
is showing clear signs that they're like
cheating on you or something like that
so a good kind of frame of reference for
this is
think of it like the core fears in the
enneagram so in the enneagram you can
have
let's say a type three and a type seven
working the same job
but they can be working that job for
completely different reasons and they
can have completely different
motivations for being in that role
so you can't figure out what someone's
enneagram type is by looking at what
they're doing
you have to look at why they're doing
the thing they're doing
and the exact same thing goes for
attachment styles so two people can be
avoiding someone
or avoiding a situation for completely
and totally
different reasons so it's extremely
important to contextualize
why you're avoiding things before you
label yourself as avoidant
so i had a conversation with some secure
friends and some anxious friends and
gathered some of the reasons why they
said they avoid people despite not being
avoidant types
some of those reasons are hey let's say
you go on a date with someone and you
just don't like them that much so being
securely attached doesn't mean that
you're gonna like
everyone you meet it just means that
when you do finally meet someone you
like there aren't going to be all these
detachment style issues in the way of
you pursuing them but a main reason
secure or anxious people will avoid
someone is just because they don't like
them but maybe they're a little bit
conflict diverse and they don't want to
tell someone that to their face and hurt
their feelings
so they'll ghost them or they'll avoid
them or they'll try not to run into them
whether that's virtually or in real life
it's very normal to have a feeling of i
don't really like someone so i don't
want to be around them that is not
attachment style avoidance
that is just being a normal human being
another very normal reason to avoid
someone
is because they're behaving
inappropriately towards you so a lot of
people are saying oh
if anxious people make me feel avoidant
i must be avoidant
no you'll often see anxious people being
very very turned off by other anxious
people because both of those people see
each other as a threat to getting their
needs met so anxious people are always
looking for someone who already has
their own needs met so that they can
take care of the anxious persons
it's unconscious that that's happening
so it's not something that they're like
aware of and putting into language but
it is there for them unconsciously so
anxious people will avoid other anxious
people because they're looking for
someone
who is not preoccupied by their own
needs and
neurotic anxieties but what's specific
to attachment
avoidance is a negative view of others
so what does that mean a negative view
of others is inherent to both the
fearful avoidance type and the avoidant
type
so both the anxious type and the secure
type have a positive view of others and
what that means is that
both secure and anxious people feel like
other people generally
are trustworthy and okay and able to
meet my needs so it might take a little
bit of time for them to find the right
person to do that
but the fearful avoidant and the
avoidant type both believe
that other people are going to suck them
dry energetically
so both the fearful avoidant and the
avoidant type are actually
most afraid of emotional intimacy so
they are the least avoidant
when things are chill so when you enter
into like a very casual relationship of
any sort with an avoidance spectrum
person so fearful avoidant or avoidant
they're actually very comfortable with
that but where avoidant people freak out
is when the relationship
is happy comfortable and it's emotional
intimacy time so that's where anxious
and secure people shine they really want
that emotional intimacy they really want
that togetherness
and the fearful avoidance will want that
initially but then as soon as they're
there
all of these triggers go off in their
mind because for the fearful avoidant
and the avoidant person
they have this very deep core belief
that
loving someone means giving them more
than you have
and i don't know how to describe this
other than
if you had this i really think you would
know
because it's so nonsensical and so
intense
that i really think it's one of those
things where you either have it and you
know you have it or you don't
i could be wrong but i really think this
isn't that confusing of a situation
because it's so weird
that if this is something that's present
for you you just know avoidant people
when they go into a relationship as soon
as things start getting comfortable
um serious like it's commitment time
something fires off in their brain that
goes other people are not okay
other people are unable to take care of
themselves so if i make a commitment to
this person
it means that forever they will be
sucking my resources out of me and i
will be giving more than i have
now this is an unconscious feeling so it
doesn't necessarily come forward in that
language
but it's a very strong feeling of
discomfort and feeling like you're being
smothered emotionally
why are you so afraid of giving this a
chance because i am scared of
how much i like you oh this is a bad
idea oh you're right
this is a mistake yes no i love you
let's be friends
okay friends then i love you uh let's
get married no you're smothering me
okay forget it and again this is
different than actual emotional
smothering so a secure person who's
being smothered might be like ah get
away if someone's really like you know
coming at them really strong
but in the avoidant person it's actually
most likely to happen with someone they
really like and feel strongly about
so for me i've had the strongest
avoidant responses in my life
when i've realized like this is someone
i'm involved with who i really
love and who i actually am starting to
see a life i could have with them
that's when every single alarm bell in
my mind starts going off so the last two
times i've realized in my life
that i'm in love with someone i have
immediately broken up with that person
and in both cases left the country
within a week
and those are extreme responses i also
live like nomadically so it's not as big
a deal for me as it is for other people
but it is that level of intense
response like that feeling of i love
someone
and i could see myself getting really
emotionally invested in them
and really see myself like feeling very
attached
to them in some way is the most
terrifying feeling on earth for
avoidance spectrum people because they
associate
love and emotional intimacy with people
taking from them because whatever was
present for them in their early years
was normally some form of unhealthy
relationship where
love was equivalent to their boundaries
being violated
and this experience is
awful and chaotic um
and it ruins your life your love life
at least the rest of your life is
probably fine
but it is something that is truly
debilitating in relationships which is
why i say
like if you're on the avoidance spectrum
you usually know
and it will feel heavier for fearful
avoidance than it does for avoidance
because when fearful avoidance jumps
ship
they usually feel very deeply
emotionally invested already
in a way that the dismissive avoidant
does not always feel
um so fearful avoidance tend to feel
like they're fighting against their own
minds and their own hearts
all of the time and they don't
understand why dismissive avoidance tend
to feel more like
i don't know why i don't feel what i'm
supposed to feel in relationships it's
just not really there for me at the same
level of intensity
or at least at the same pace as it is
for other people
but yeah it's really really not
avoiding someone because you're busy
it's not avoiding someone because you've
got something going on
it's the specific trigger of love
equals get the out in your mind
so the kind of avoidance that secure and
anxious people feel
is generally situationally appropriate
avoidance and we talked about this in my
last video
but i think people kind of thought of it
as like oh that's kind of a side point
no it's like the whole piece
if you feel situationally appropriate
avoidance so if you're avoiding people
you don't like
avoiding people you don't want
relationships with avoiding people
because you're going through a difficult
time those are all situationally
appropriate avoidance responses
if you're avoiding someone because you
realize you're in love with them
because you've realized you could see a
future with them because you just had a
wonderful week or a wonderful date with
them and things are going really well
and for some reason that fires off all
of these alarm bells in your brain that
goes
oh my god committing to someone it means
giving to them forever
in a way that i don't have it in me to
give that is attachment avoidance it is
intimacy triggering your alarm bells not
uncomfortable situations triggering your
alarm bells so as an avoidant type
myself i usually feel very very
comfortable in the early stages of a
relationship
um when i'm just kind of getting to know
someone there's like no commitment
involved and i might even like feel very
excited about people in those stages
and then as soon as i start developing
feelings for them and this
i'm gonna have to say is absolutely
without fail for me
um i've had two serious relationships in
my life and i've had
maybe two other people who i've felt
like i'm falling in love with this
person
and every single time so of those four
times
every single time i've started to get
those strong feelings
i have in some way cut off the
relationship in two of the cases
permanently
in the two other cases i ended up
getting back together with that person
in the future
but what happens in my mind is i have
that association go off of
okay i feel very strongly for someone
that means i'm gonna commit to them and
that commitment means giving up my
independence it means giving up the life
that i want it means i have to all of a
sudden cater to this person's needs
and then my brain goes oh my god other
people's needs are overwhelming they're
going to want way more than you
feel comfortable giving them and how are
you gonna set proper boundaries and it
just feels
so overwhelming that i will do anything
to get out of that situation
okay i was editing this video and i had
to come back and correct something that
i said
in this video which is that at the time
i wasn't present of all of the feelings
that i'm telling you about now
so in each of those situations i wasn't
aware in two of the situations i wasn't
even aware that i was feeling
those feelings for those people it took
me a while to like reflect on the
situation be like oh
i was in love with that person um that
often takes me a very long time to
realize
in two of the situations i was aware of
my feelings but
what happened wasn't like this process
of me going oh i love them so i have to
get out
in one case i literally thought me and
this person
having very different taste in movies
was a reason why we could not spend our
lives together like that was my reason
and this was someone i had very strong
feelings for but i was like well we
don't like the same movies
i can't get over that all of a sudden it
was the only thing i could think of
um i thought it was going to be the end
of the world so there will be these very
irrational critical thoughts that come
up
that distract you as an avoidant from
the real feelings which is
feeling overwhelmed by the fact that
you're in love and that means that
you have certain associations that come
up with that um it took me years of like
self-discovery and self-reflection and
hypnotherapy and attachment work to
realize like that's the specific
subconscious process that's going on for
me
but there will always be a feeling of
like oh for some reason
it all of a sudden feels very very
imminent that i get the out of this
relationship
that is attachment avoidance it is
this very painful experience
of loving someone and having that
love be your biggest trigger it's
awful it's awful
um
yeah it's not it's not a sensical
avoidance it is a deeply deeply
shitty response but yeah a kind of joke
that i make about it in my head is like
the secure and anxious person's worst
nightmare is that they never
meet their soul mate and fall in love
and the fearful avoidant and avoidance
worst nightmare is that they do meet
their soulmate and fall in love
because that experience of falling in
love is very triggering
inherently to the avoidant type and
there are a whole
range of deeply unhealthy coping
mechanisms that come along with that
um and there will be a slight difference
in why this happens
for the fearful avoidant versus the
dismissive avoidant so the fearful
avoidant
tends to not know what their own needs
are and they don't feel comfortable
stating their needs and in relationships
they think that they can't set
boundaries
so they will go into relationships and
just become completely
enmeshed and codependent and not know
where they end and another person begins
and they will feel like the only way to
change this is to completely get out of
the relationship they're either 200
in or 100 out they don't know there's
any in between they don't know you can
tell your partner i need some boundaries
i need some space but they really really
deeply deeply crave space in a
relationship
because they are an avoidant type then
there's the dismissive avoidant
who will set a lot of boundaries around
themselves in the relationship
and they'll feel like if my partner
tries to violate too many of these
boundaries i'm gonna have to get rid of
the partner because nothing is more
important to me
than what's inside the walls of my
boundaries because what's inside the
walls of my boundaries is my ability to
keep myself feeling safe and okay
but yeah another kind of shitty trait of
being avoidant that i almost hesitate to
bring up because i don't want people to
i would say i don't want people to know
about this i don't want people to
make harsh judgments of the avoidant
type because of this without properly
understanding that this comes from a
trauma response
but avoidance have that negative view of
others so often what will happen
is that as soon as things start getting
comfortable in the relationship with an
avoidant or fearful avoidant type
the avoidant or fearful avoidant type
starts criticizing their partner in
their heads so they'll pick on something
where all of a sudden they're like oh
this thing means that this person will
never be the one for me and they fixate
on some flaw that their partner has real
or imagined or some perceived
incompatibility that suddenly is just
screamingly apparent to them
and they'll decide because of this thing
this person will never be the person for
me
therefore i have to leave the
relationship so it's that negative view
of others that comes in
and helps them find a reason to leave
the relationship because their
attachment wound is getting triggered
so just to recap avoidance as an
attachment style is
not the same as avoidant behavior in the
securely attached person
so there are a million reasons why
anyone would avoid other people
but you have to look at is your
avoidance being triggered
by intimacy and closeness so when you
get really close
and comfortable and committed with
someone is that
something that sends every siren in your
brain
off screaming and make you feel like you
need to get as far away as you can from
that relationship
that is attachment avoidance um if you
have any questions about this
let me know in the comments and i'm
happy to explain a little bit more i am
going to be sharing more of my
experiences
um with the avoidant attachment style as
we go on through this series
so hopefully that will also help clarify
some things i think
the avoidant type is one that because
not a lot of avoidant people
end up talking about or taking an
interest in attachment theory
there isn't a very nuanced understanding
of what it means to be avoidant in
relationships
but it's a very very contradictory and
difficult
experience so i'm gonna hopefully be
able to elucidate it a little bit more
as we go on
but in the meantime um yeah any
questions you have about the difference
between attachment avoidance so
avoidance that
is triggered by the fear of intimacy
versus regular avoidance which could be
happening for a plethora of reasons
leave them below and i will try to
answer them as best as i can
i love you guys but not enough to break
up with you and leave the country i love
you
a very normal human amount and i hope
you have an awesome night
