hey welcome back to my channel it's been
a couple weeks today we're here to talk
about
a combination of two of my favorite
systems which are the drama triangle
and the empowerment dynamic which i kind
of like linked together as one system
because the empowerment dynamic is the
antidote to the drama triangle
and attachment styles so i am of the
opinion
that you absolutely cannot begin to work
on your attachment style until you step
out of the drama triangle
and i'll explain in a minute what that
means but basically when i started doing
attachment work i started looking for
communities online
where people were also doing attachment
work and i noticed that
a lot of the communities out there were
just full of people
talking about the other attachment
style so you'd get a whole bunch of
anxiously attached people
just talking about dismissive
avoidance and being like how do i deal
with this relationship with the
dismissive avoidance they're devaluing
me they're not paying enough attention
to me
how do i get them to love me and i'm
like okay this is not attachment work
and that's not to say that um anxiously
attached people are the only people who
are kind of doing that talking and
not doing the work
people everywhere are not doing the work
just dismissive avoidance are more quiet
about it and fearful avoidance are
too busy tending to their own chaotic
relationships generally to go online and
project that much
i'm guessing um but it is to say
that there is this very strong theme
that's inherent to attachment trauma
of wanting it to be about the other so
you have to first recognize the bias
that you have before you begin working
on your attachment style to blame
everyone
else and take the blame off yourself so
anxiously attached people tend to feel
like oh their partners are just never
giving them enough they're giving so
much love and attention but they're
never getting enough back
avoidant people tend to feel like oh i'm
keeping myself good and okay and i'm not
putting my own problems on other people
but other people are always putting
their problems on me fearful avoidance
kind of feel like they're getting a mix
of both things like they're kind of
getting hit from every angle and the
reason that all of that is happening is
because being insecurely attached
kind of puts you automatically in the
middle of the drama triangle so the
drama triangle for those of you who
aren't familiar with it is a conflict
model that was invented by a man named
steven cartman back in i believe it was
1968
and it has its roots in transactional
analysis which is basically the field of
study that looks at how we project
all of our unresolved traumas and
problems from childhood onto other
people
and the drama triangle kind of outlines
these three roles that most of us tend
to take on during conflict and all of us
will play
all of these three roles during conflict
so it's not like oh you do one or the
other but most of us have
what we call a starting gate so a role
that we prefer to enter into conflict in
and then as the conflict goes on we'll
switch roles and to move it into healthy
territory you have to look at the sister
system which is the empowerment dynamic
and it talks about these three roles
that mirror the roles of the drama
triangle but they're healthy ways of
approaching conflict as opposed to the
drama triangle which is just kind of
this
never-ending cluster of everyone blaming
everyone else and no one wanting to take
any responsibility for making a change
for themselves
so i kind of discovered the drama
triangle when i was
25 and i was at the tail end of this
like eight year long relationship that
went on
a good five years longer than it should
have if not longer than that and i went
to this counselor in kind of a
last-ditch attempt to see if i could
gain some conflict resolution skills
that would help me save the relationship
and i sat down and just told him
everything about how horrible my partner
was
how they didn't understand me and they
didn't try to understand me and they
were doing all these things that were
keeping us unhappy and in conflict and
in stress mode
and the counselor just kind of heard me
out and then was like i
hear that you are in a really unhealthy
and toxic relationship and i was like
yes
you get me my partner is the entire
problem i'm gonna send my partner in for
therapy and i will just
see myself out and then he goes but i'm
not interested
in what your partner is doing wrong what
i'm interested in
is why you're in this relationship that
is so bad
and yet you're not leaving what is it
within you
that's causing you to stay and that was
this question that stumped me
because i was like goddammit are you
asking me to take responsibility for my
own actions
i was responsible for choosing the kind
of partnership where someone didn't let
me down
choosing the kind of partnership where
someone was honest with me choosing the
kind of partnership where there was
mutual trust
and where nobody needed to go on a
one-hour long rant to their counselor
about the other
because they could sit down and discuss
things calmly and the
fact that i was endlessly going after
partnerships that were unhealthy was a
me problem
and that's when i started initially
looking into attachment styles in
relation to myself
and it was also when i got really
intimately acquainted with the drama
triangle
so the three roles in the drama triangle
are called victim persecutor and savior
and when i walked into the counselor's
room that day i was in victim mode so i
thought all of this bad stuff is
happening to me
i'm powerless to change it my partner
needs to change it because they
caused it when you're in victim mode
that's the exact mindset that you have
you think that
unless you caused a problem you are
powerless to change it
or that you shouldn't be the one to
change it and what that plays on is this
kind of deep desire for justice that
most of us have like we think if someone
did something wrong to us
they should be the ones to fix it we
shouldn't have to fix it but the truth
of the matter is that when you're in
that headspace and you're waiting for
this savior to come along and fix your
life and fix your problems and fix the
way you feel
you are completely disempowered your
happiness and your well-being is
completely in someone else's hands and a
lot of us get stuck in that position in
relationships
when our partner does something wrong
real or imagined and then we give them
this mindset of well there's nothing i
can do until they change and that is the
victim mindset
going into a conflict situation in a
victim mindset means you're trying
everything you can think of under the
sun to get someone else to see how badly
they hurt you
and how they need to be the one to
change and to restore the relationship
to equilibrium
the second role is persecutor and
persecutor is similar to the victim in
that they feel like they've been wronged
but instead of taking a kind of passive
aggressive stance where they're playing
the poor me game
they're going aggressive and they're
walking into the conflict going you did
this wrong you need to fix this
x y and z needs to change i don't need
to change
you're the one who needs to get your act
together and here's how you can do it
the persecutor takes a very direct and a
very harsh approach and they're trying
to very bluntly call out the other
person for what they've done wrong and
what they need to do in order to fix
things so the persecutor like the victim
is outsourcing their well-being they're
telling someone okay
i won't be okay until you fix this this
and this so i need you to do that so
that i can return to equilibrium and
once again that's a very disempowered
stance
even though it feels empowering in the
moment like you can go into persecution
mode
and feel strong and in control because
you're telling someone exactly what you
need
but unless you're capable of getting
that thing without someone else's
participation you're not really in the
position of power you're in a position
where you're outsourcing your needs just
a lot more aggressively than the victim
is the third role in the drama triangle
is the savior so the savior is
constantly on the hunt for people who
they perceive to be broken or flawed or
who have some kind of
deep need that needs filling in some way
and the savior only feels good about
themselves when they're acting as kind
of a martyr and putting their own needs
aside to help or support someone else
and that sounds nice in theory but what
it really is is the creation of a
co-dependent relationship because the
savior is not looking to empower someone
they're not looking to truly help
someone in a lasting way
they're unconsciously looking to create
dependency in a relationship
by finding someone who they trick into
needing them the savior kind of thinks
i'll be loved if i'm needed so they go
out looking for people who need saving
and in a conflict we'll all take on
these three different roles at various
points so when someone enters into
conflict in one of these
roles the other person is automatically
forced into one of the other two roles
so let's say someone comes to you
playing victim
and they're going oh you know i'm so
hurt i'm so upset because of these
things that you did and you're not
taking responsibility for it but can't
you see my life is falling apart because
of these choices you made a better
relationship
that forces you into either persecution
mode so you can point the finger back at
them and go well actually
you did this this and this that led to
that or you can go into savior mode and
you can put your own needs aside and put
your own feelings aside
and go okay let me change the situation
and give up what i need in favor of what
you need
so that i can kind of rescue you but the
problem is that
that breeds resentment so the savior
often lives in this position of kind of
ongoing chronic resentment
because they felt as though fixing
someone else's problems
meant that they should get love in
return now so the savior
will savor someone and then immediately
put themselves mentally in the victim
status because they're going
well i put my needs aside but now this
person isn't attending to my needs which
was the kind of unconscious contract
that i'd entered into when i agreed to
help them i expected them to then turn
around and go okay now i'll meet your
needs so now the savior has moved to the
victim position and they're walking
around in their heads feeling victimized
and like someone else has to come now
meet their
needs before they'll feel happy and okay
so you are in the drama triangle
without exception no exceptions to this
anytime you feel like
i won't be happy until someone else
changes
now your resentment your anger your
victimization
might be valid maybe someone truly did
hurt you maybe you are
really in a position where you are
unfortunate and down on your luck and
it's someone else's fault but as long as
you are waiting for someone to come
along and save you from the
responsibility of figuring out a
solution to that
you're in the drama triangle so position
where you are not taking responsibility
are not showing up for yourself
and are instead outsourcing the things
you need to other people and asking
other people to restore you
to health and happiness insanity and
it's just not a fun position to be in
because it doesn't really get you to
where you want to go very efficiently at
best
it kind of gets you halfway to somewhere
with a whole bunch of resentment
and it just never works out for the best
so to take yourself out of the drama
triangle you a have to realize you're in
it
and then b look at what the mirroring
role is in the empowerment dynamics so
again the empowerment dynamic is a
system that mirrors the drama triangles
so where we have the victim in the drama
triangle we have the creator in the
empowerment dynamic
the creator is someone who believes that
they have endless options available to
them that they can call upon at any
point in time so the creator is always
asking themselves the question
even if things are bad even if things
have gone wrong even if someone else has
wronged me
what options are still available to me
so my counselor looked at me that day
that i came into his office
and listened to my story and then went
okay even if this relationship
is that bad even if your partner is the
devil incarnate
which options do you have available to
yourself he was inviting me to step into
the creator role
and look at options like i could leave
the relationship i could learn some
better boundary setting skills
i could learn to stop playing savior and
then feeling victimized afterwards so i
had all of these options available to me
that i didn't even notice
because i was so stuck in this
disempowered position that i wasn't
taking stock of what i still had control
over
the role in the empowerment dynamic that
mirrors the role of the persecutor is
the role of the challenger so when
you're in persecution mode you're always
pointing the finger at the other and
going here's what you're doing wrong
here's what you need to change
when you're in challenger position
you're looking at how can i learn from
this situation even if someone else
doesn't change
so how can this conflict teach me
something how can i learn new skills
through this how can i make it through
this experience
and become a better person because of it
even if the experience itself was
negative
so rather than asking your environment
to change on your behalf you're inviting
yourself to change and learn and grow
even if your environment stays constant
third position in the empowerment
dynamic is the coach coach is a position
that mirrors the savior role in the
drama triangle
so while the savior looks to create
codependent relationships
the coach encourages themselves and
other people to be independent so the
coach sees both themselves and other
people as creators so they think i have
endless opportunities to make my life
better
available to me and other people have
endless opportunities to make their
lives better available to them now we
don't all have the same opportunities we
don't all have the same advantages
but they believe that every single
person is capable inherently of showing
up for themselves and making their lives
better
and that's very different from the
savior who thinks oh other people need
me to be okay
the coach thinks other people don't need
me to be okay and i'm gonna remind them
of that if they've forgotten that so
that we don't get trapped in this
codependent dynamic
where everyone feels enmeshed and
uncomfortable and resentful of each
other because no one's fully expressing
themselves and setting proper boundaries
so we've all played victim we've all
played persecutor we've all played
savior but
most of us have a preferred starting
point so we're going to talk now about
the three
insecurely attached styles so anxious
avoidant and fearful avoidant
and what their starting gate role is in
the drama triangle and how they can
change that tendency to an empowered
version of it
to put themselves into the middle of the
empowerment dynamic rather than staying
stuck in the drama triangle because
again
you cannot begin to work on your
attachment style
until you start acknowledging that you
need to change
not the other and i'm going to say that
again because it's so important the
number one thing you need to do in order
to begin working on your attachment
style
is stop waiting for other people to
change
if you are waiting for your partner to
change your parents to change
your friends to change your situation to
change you are in the middle of the
drama triangle and you will stay there
your entire life lots of people do but
if you're willing to recognize that all
of that stuff may never change
but you can and you can start responding
to those things differently
showing up differently showing up for
yourself differently engaging with your
environment differently
then you have a giant almost endless
amount of opportunity available to you
that you did not have available to you
before
but you have to make that very firm
decision to stop waiting for everyone
else to change
and to decide that you are going to
change even if no one else does
and obviously that looks a little bit
different for each of us it's not this
thing where you realize the drama
triangle exists and then you step out of
it and then you're out of it forever
you will have to catch yourself doing
this over and over and over and over and
over again for your entire life
but the more often you catch yourself
doing it and the more often you then
switch yourself into empowered position
the better and better your life gets
because the more control you have over
your own happiness and health and
well-being and that's an awesome thing
so let me know where you're at in this
process in the comments i'm gonna have a
lot more videos coming up about how to
do the work on each of the attachment
styles specifically but this is step one
for each of them
also before we go remember that if you
are an infp or an enfp personality type
i run bootcamps for your personality
types at www.heidipreeb.com i'll put the
link in the description as well as on
the bottom of this video
and i will see you there if that calls
to you otherwise i will see you here
later this week as we keep the
attachment style conversations going
