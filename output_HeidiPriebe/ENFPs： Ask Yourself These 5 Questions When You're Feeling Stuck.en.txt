hey guys heidi preep here welcome back
to my channel i
am wearing my new favorite shirt today
it i don't know if you can see it
but um it says it's never too late to do
better on it
and i feel like at this point in my life
that is
kind of my entire life motto i am
turning 30 this year
and i am absolutely nowhere in any
capacity close to where
i thought that i would be at age 30 and
i kind of like that a lot for myself
because i think that this year has been
the
single most humbling year of my life
it's a year where i had to
kind of break down a lot of ego defenses
break down a lot of what used to work
for me and find new pathways forward and
i think that humbled
is the best feeling that we can feel
because i think that when we are humble
we are the most open to learning and
growth and change
that we will ever be at any point in our
lives this is one of the reasons besides
the fact that their brains are so
elastic
why children learn so much so fast so
effectively right because they don't
have this existing
schema of the world to measure what they
already know up against so they retain
so much information in such a small
amount of time
and if we can learn to do that as adults
if we can learn to
loosen the reins on our ego a bit and
accept that we're perpetually beginners
in a lot of ways
um we can learn like that too and that's
a lot of what this video is going to be
about
so anyways for those of you who don't
know me i am the author of the
comprehensive enfp survival guide and
the comprehensive infp survival guide
you might also know me from the myriad
articles that i used to write on mbti
for thought catalog
or you might know me because you met me
traveling or on the street or this video
just popped up after you watched a frank
jane's video in which case welcome
it's wonderful to meet you i'm so happy
that however you ended up here you ended
up here
so today we're going to be talking about
something that i think is such a
recurring problem for anyone of any
types you don't have to be an enfp to
relate to this
in fact this advice is pretty
generalizable but i want to speak
through the lens of our cognitive
functions just because that's what i do
and that's generally what i use this
channel for so we're going to talk about
what it looks like when an enfp is
feeling
stuck in life and what questions we need
to be asking ourselves to kind of
get things moving in a different
direction to say that i have felt stuck
in my own life is a massive
understatement i
am the master of holding on to things
long long long after i should
and staying in situations thinking i can
make this better i can fix this i can
get out of this rut
i can look at the past and remember what
was and go yeah i can definitely
recreate that in the future not
realizing that
the context has shifted that the
situation i'm in
calls for new skills to be developed i
am really really good
really good at holding on to things for
way too long
so i personally find myself stuck in
life a lot this is something that i have
had to learn to deal with
over and over again in my life to
recognize to bring awareness to and then
to start forming new strategies around
so i just wanted to share some of what's
worked for me when i find myself in a
spot where i'm stuck in life or where i
feel like i'm kind of doing the same
thing over and over again without
getting better results
because i think that there are some
really crucial questions we can ask
ourselves during these periods
that can help us expand our awareness
into new areas and those new areas will
become the route forward
so this can be applied to relationships
it can be applied to jobs it can be
applied to
living situations it can be applied to
lifestyle preferences
literally absolutely any area where you
feel like you're kind of spinning your
wheels
and if you're watching this video i'm
guessing that you already kind of know
which area you want to focus your
attention on during this video but it
could be many areas so a lot of times in
my life i have had this feeling of
i feel kind of stuck and like i don't
know where to go next but i can't even
identify what needs to change is it my
job is it my mindset is it my
relationship
is it my social circle is it where i'm
living is it what i'm doing
and that feeling can be super
overwhelming so not even knowing where
to start
is one of the biggest things that i
think keeps us stuck and that's totally
fine so if you're watching this
and you feel that feeling of i'm not
progressing or moving towards the things
i want in life but i don't know what the
problem is
that's totally fine so question one that
i want you to ask yourself if this is
where you're finding yourself
is what are you hungry for and i think
that
ninety percent of the time when you ask
this question to someone who
self-identifies as being stuck in life
their answer is going to be nothing and
that is the entire problem that's the
whole thing right there
that's not part of the problem that is
why you're stuck if you are not
hungry for something in a intense
visceral
palpable way you're not going to be
pushing your life forward because you're
not going to have the motivation to
the single most valuable thing that we
can have in life
is motivation it is more important than
knowledge than skill than ability
if you have all of those things but
you're not motivated to put any of them
to use
you're going to get absolutely nowhere
and what motivates us to act
is hunger is desire is wanting something
and perceiving a chasm between where we
are and where that thing that we want is
and if we don't perceive that chasm
anywhere guess what happens a lot of
nothing
our lives stagnate we fail to learn we
fail to grow we fail to push ourselves
and we end up just kind of spinning our
wheels doing the same thing over and
over again now
there are many ways to be hungry you can
be mentally hungry you can be
spiritually hungry you can be
emotionally or intellectually hungry and
if you're
feeling like you're none of those things
it's probably because you're
already full up on junk food and this is
something that i actually see a lot of
enfp struggling with because we are
so addicted to the feeling at times of
self-growth and self-awareness and
self-development
that we aren't always distinguishing
whether we're doing real growth or
whether we're doing
pseudogrowth so let's say that you have
a lot of shallow
or surface level relationships with
people who aren't really challenging you
or pushing you
or who aren't really providing new
perspectives in your life but they're
filling some need whether it's for
comfort whether it's your own
wanting to avoid your inner world right
i'm very guilty of that when i want to
avoid what's truly happening inside
i surround myself with people who are
completely and totally outward facing
and who also don't want to go inward
and that keeps it really really easy to
not do the work that you know you
actually need to do internally so maybe
it's relationships that aren't really
getting to the core of what you need out
of relationships maybe you are working a
job
that's paying your bills or even that
you've become exceptionally good at but
that no longer speaks to you or that no
longer really really excites you in the
way that it used to and i think that
this is again
something that enfps really have to
watch out for we
love the learning process so we have a
tendency to go
all in on something and get really good
really fast and then plateau
and once we hit that plateau the problem
is that that's often the point where
let's say it's a job you're earning a
lot of money you're good at what you do
if it's a relationship things are
functioning pretty smoothly you have a
routine down
and we try to deny our own need for
novelty and change
if you are denying that need because
your ego cup is so full that you're
worried about it spilling over if you
make the slightest change
you're gonna start dying a slow and
painful death inside of your own soul
as you try to keep living this life that
was once exciting and fun and
interesting
and now has stagnated not because
something is wrong with you
but because what you loved was the
learning process was the process of
being hungry for something
and going for it and watching yourself
get closer that is the most exciting
place you can be in so if you arrive at
that end goal and you're like why am i
not happy well because your favorite
part is over you're learning your growth
your change
has come to an end and now you have to
make yourself hungry
for something else in order to get that
feeling back and that's
okay right so society kind of tells us
that
we should always be striving to get to
the top of the mountain and
for us for any dominant types who are
obsessed with the growth and development
process
the top of the mountain is the most
boring part you look at the view for
three seconds you're like nice
cool and now guess what it's time to do
descend that mountain
find the next one that's where it's
exciting for you and it's a scary thing
to do
because a lot of the time getting hungry
for something means
allowing room in your system for that
hunger to develop so it might mean
taking a step back from those
relationships that aren't necessarily
growing you anymore
carving out time for yourself within a
partnership to do more
independent growth work taking a bit of
a step back from the career that you've
become really good at
to start honing and finessing some new
interests it's gonna mean
losing something and i think that when
we're stuck we often stay stuck because
we don't want to lose anything that we
have in order to gain something new but
it doesn't work like that you're gonna
have to lose
a little bit of comfort a little bit of
stability maybe a little bit of prestige
or recognition
a little bit of ego and pride in order
to figure out what that next thing
that's really gonna fill you up is
and you have to be ready to do that but
we're gonna talk more about what that
looks like later on
question number two i would encourage
you to ask yourself if you're feeling
stuck in life
is are you putting pressure in the wrong
places so
as enfps once again we kind of get in
the flow of something our introverted
sensing internalizes what works and what
doesn't and by the way if you don't know
what i'm talking about when i say terms
like
n-e-f-i-t-e-s-i those are the enfp's
cognitive functions
i do run a six-week enfp soul bootcamp
course
where we go over all of the characters
that govern the inside of your mind and
how they operate behind the scenes to
help you learn
grow interact make decisions reflect
observe your own psyche
and you can find that boot camp at
www.heidiprev.com the link is in the
description to this video but as i was
saying
introverted sensing tends to internalize
what works and then our natural tendency
when we feel stuck or overwhelmed or
like something isn't working the way it
used to is to just
triple down on that thing right so go
harder and harder in that area
and i was thinking about this the other
day in relation to this memory i have of
driving down this road in rural
guatemala i was visiting with a couple
of friends and we're going to this house
on the coast and the bus skidded off of
the side of the road a little bit and it
went
into this ditch and the back wheel sunk
down into the ditch
and it was covered in sand and it seemed
like it was going to be a really easy
thing to just kind of get the bus
out of the ditch so we all got out it's
like the middle of the night it's dark
we got lost along the way we're all
frustrated and we're like
five minutes from the house we're so
close so we're like okay we'll just get
to the back of the bus
and we will push and we did that and
what happened was that the bus
ended up going even deeper into the sand
so all of the effort we were exerting
because the bus's wheel was pointed
downwards we were actually pushing the
bus
further and further into the dirt the
more that we applied pressure
and our lives when we're feeling stuck
kind of work like this
if we were going in one direction that
was making us stuck
because the law of diminishing returns
came into play maybe we were on a high
for a little bit and then
what we were doing started feeling less
and less fulfilling or exciting or
giving us the returns that we wanted
our impulse is to push harder when what
we actually need to do
is take a step back and re-evaluate the
situation
and create a strategic plan for what
happens next
now as enfps this is not something that
we naturally
love to do the part of the brain that
really likes strategic planning is more
related to introverted intuition or in
some aspects introverted thinking
both of which are cognitive functions
that we do not favor
at all they're right in the bottom of
our cognitive stacking we don't love
going there
but the fact that we don't love going
there means we often get ourselves in
these situations
where we're applying pressure in the
wrong areas and once again in the enfp
sole bootcamp we talk a lot more about
how introverted intuition and
introverted thinking as well as our
other two shadow functions extraverted
sensing and extroverted feeling
show up in the enfp psyche and how you
can harness them to help you support
your dominant four cognitive functions
not to replace them because that's never
gonna work
but we do have to have a base awareness
of them in order to use them effectively
yeah i've been looking over the data
that si collected and it actually
arranges itself quite meaningfully
happiness for the enfp is predicted not
by travel itself
but by the presence of a meaningful
close-knit community
the availability of new physical
adventures and an abundance of new
fantasies
are you trying to tell me that i can't
fix every single problem i've ever had
by just getting on a plane and going to
patagonia
that's uh that's more or less it yeah
where we need to start using introverted
intuition is
in these situations where we find that
we are spinning our wheels
what we probably need is a strategic
plan out of the mud we need to step back
observe our situation observe how we got
into that situation
and also figure out which small
methodical changes
are going to put us back on the right
track so that day we were stuck in the
mud in guatemala what we ended up doing
was getting a plank of wood putting it
underneath the wheel of the car
and then we were able to push the car
out of the mud because there was a ramp
that was pushing it forward in the right
direction
and what you need to do when you're
feeling stuck as an enfp or as any type
is figure out what your ramp is so where
have you started going downhill where
has that law of diminishing returns come
into play for you and in those moments
what we have to do
is stop putting pressure on our lives
completely
as much as humanly possible and i'm
really serious about this for myself
i'm self-employed so i have a bit of a
different situation but when i
feel like i'm spinning my wheels
professionally i stop working
and i get really quiet with myself and i
really look at my situation
and i go what do i dread doing every day
what is boring for me now that used to
be exciting
that i can no longer bring the same
spark to what do i
truly just not want to do anymore where
is the law of diminishing returns coming
into play for me
and every single time i get really quiet
and really honest with myself
and ask myself that question i get an
answer
and when i get rid of that thing in my
life guess what happens a little bit of
hunger opens up
a little bit of curiosity a little bit
of time freeze up that i can now use
to research or to connect with people or
to think about a new topic or a new side
hobby that's really interesting to me
and guess what happens when i have that
little bit of hunger i start moving in a
different direction
you cannot apply pressure and set up a
ramp at the same time
it's not going to work you have to give
yourself a break
energetically emotionally mentally
take a step back from whatever it is
that you've been trying so damn hard at
let it breathe and then figure out what
needs to change
it will feel terrifying because not
being in constant motion is not natural
for us as enfps
we like to move very quickly but it is
absolutely
imperative to figuring out our next
better route forward there's this author
named judy hollis who i reference a lot
who wrote a book called fat is a family
affair where she talks about how eating
disorders are both born and healed
within family systems
and she says at the beginning of the
book i'm going to give you a solution
to your problem with food addiction and
the solution is going to take you
probably about five years and most
people who i give the solution to
immediately go i don't want the five
year solution you know give me the five
week solution give me the five month
solution
and her response is always five years
are going to pass
whether you take this solution or not if
you're 35 right now
you're gonna be 40 in five years so you
can be 40
with this problem eternally solved for
you or you can be 40 with this problem
still
active for you because five years ago
you chose the quick fix that didn't give
you lasting results
but that time is going to pass whether
you choose to do it in a meaningful and
intentional way or not
and that's something that can be
difficult for us to remember as enfps
because we like to fix the problem right
now right it feels so good when we feel
like we've cracked this equation i've
figured out the solution now i can just
implement it right away
but there are a lot of parts of our
lives where slow methodical movement
towards the place we want to be
is really really important and what it
takes to get there
is slowing down examining the
introverted sensing habits that we've
put into place
and figuring out am i putting pressure
on any of these habits in a way that's
driving me deeper into the dirt
and if so how can i set up a ramp of new
habits
that are going to provide me with an
upwards trajectory out of this ditch so
that whether it's five weeks five months
or five years from now
i'm in a very different place than i'm
in today because i'm applying pressure
in the right area the automated habits
that are currently running my life
that i'm constantly applying pressure to
are taking me somewhere
better not somewhere worse question
number three i would encourage everyone
to ask themselves
when they're in a situation where they
feel stuck is which
of my problems are actually solutions
to deeper problems i promise you
i promise you this question
if you ask yourself honestly and answer
it honestly
will completely and totally change your
life for the better
i am of the absolutely firm belief
that nobody gets addicted to anything
and when i use the word
addicted i'm not just talking about drug
and alcohol addicts i'm talking about
addicted to relationships addicted to
jobs that are no longer working addicted
to certain lifestyle preferences
addicted to making money addicted to
online shopping addicted to watching tv
addicted to
self-improvement there are a million
things that it's so easy
for us to get completely fixated on and
lose
the spirit and joy and curiosity that
is inborn to our experience of life
because we are completely consumed by
these other things and those other
things
are actually solutions to deeper
problems in our lives
if something were only ever bad we would
not do it that's not how the brain works
that's not how reward pathways work
reward pathways in our brain respond
to stimuli that is pleasurable in some
way so
we are motivated to act on what we
believe is going to make us feel
something positive so let's say you are
in a bad relationship that you really
want to get out of but for some reason
you just can't figure out how to leave
okay figure out what is the positive
feedback loop that i'm in in this
relationship
so what am i so addicted to what do i
love so much about this bad situation
that i can't seem to extract myself from
it what problem
is it solving for me maybe you have low
self-esteem
and you believe no one else is ever
going to love me so even though i'm not
happy in this relationship it is solving
the problem
of the way that i feel about myself i
feel good knowing that this person loves
and wants to be with me
until you can find a way to solve that
problem in a different way
you are going to stay in that
relationship because it's the quickest
and easiest
fix for the underlying problem of low
self-esteem or this could be
a professional situation let's say
you're in a career where you're no
longer interested or motivated or
inspired or you're studying something
that you don't really care about
okay what are you getting out of that
situation there's a really good book
called
how we change in 10 reasons why we don't
by ross ellenhorn i've talked about it
on this channel before but it's
fantastic
and it goes over exactly this how to
figure out
why you're still where you are even
though mentally you think i really want
to be somewhere else and i can visualize
it
but i can't seem to motivate myself to
move towards it
it's probably because you're discounting
how much you're getting out of the
situation that you're in
if that bad job is giving you security
and stability and a sense of normalcy in
your life
and those things are really important to
you those are some of your core needs
you're not going to leave until you find
a much better way to satisfy
all three of those needs if you're
drinking a bottle of wine every single
night because you have trauma from your
childhood that you haven't processed or
unpacked
and you feel this chronic low-grade
depression and the only way to relieve
it is to reach for substances
and i've been there no judgment i know
it's gonna be really hard to motivate
yourself to change
until you're dealing with the discomfort
that you feel that's causing you to
reach for that alcohol for that
unhealthy relationship for that phone to
get the instagram likes or for that
second piece of cake that you don't
really want to eat
any bad habit that you have is
absolutely a solution
to another problem whether that problem
is practical or emotional in nature
often emotional and until you're looking
at that problem
until you're looking at what's under the
surface your surface level behaviors
will absolutely persist and if you quit
them a different surface level behavior
will pop up as a consequence of that
core problem
in order for me to quit eating and
drinking emotionally both of which i'd
been doing since
about 12 years old i had to do really
really deep work on healing my
attachment style
because i was constantly turning to
substances to comfort me
because i didn't know how to comfort
myself because i was not in touch with
my true emotions because i didn't know
what was going on for me under the
surface
i had to learn that and i had to learn
to respond to that
and once i did i stopped wanting surface
level comfort because i had
the deep comfort that i was seeking but
if i'd only looked at food or
only looked at alcohol as the problem i
would never have arrived there i would
never have figured out what those things
were a solution to
and solve that problem and once you
solve that problem
you don't really want the surface level
solutions anymore they don't feel as
good as the deeper one
and so this is a really really important
question ask yourself
question number four is one that i stole
from gabor mate who is an
absolutely brilliant addictions and
trauma specialist if you've never heard
of him or if you've never read any of
his stuff
please pause this video go research
gabor mate and consume everything that
he's ever written i wonder about his
type a lot my leading guess
is intj but i'm not sure i think he's
got fi and te i don't know in what order
my second guess would maybe be infp um
let me know your thoughts in the
comments but anyways i was watching a
documentary starring him called the
wisdom of trauma that was put out this
year
and in the documentary he's interviewing
this woman who is talking about how she
had really crippling depression and she
had a lot of
guilt over that depression she felt like
she was failing herself and the people
around her
and he sat down with this woman and was
talking to her
about how depression can call us to
realize what's going wrong in our lives
can
call us to go inward and process things
that we really need to process it can
cause us to realize
what's important to us what's no longer
working for us and where we need to go
next in our healing process and he was
saying that if you look at depression
that way
depression is not a failure depression
can be a success
your depression can be the thing that
pushes you out of what wasn't working
and into what is
and i remember at the time that i was
watching this video i was not working i
had
completely and totally stopped doing any
sort of
freelance or independent work because i
was so
focused on doing trauma healing and it
was taking
truly 100 of my time 100 of my energy
100
of what i had in me to give and as a
result
i was going into debt and i was very
stressed about that
and i had about a million solutions for
getting out of it
and i would not encourage anyone truly
i'm not encouraging you to go into debt
um i want to make that clear i knew that
i had the resources to get out of this
the second that i wanted to i have
connections in my field i'm a freelancer
i can hop very quickly back into the
workforce
but i remember just asking myself
instead of panicking
about how to get out of debt what if i
asked myself the question
what would make this debt a success what
would make
the fact that i put rent for this month
on my credit card
worthwhile and the answer very clearly
came to me if you came
out of this period with better coping
mechanisms with
more self-awareness with some deep work
having been done
on all of the traumas and
challenges and areas of your psyche that
are not functioning properly that you've
been putting off for almost 30 years
if you could do that with this time
the debt would be a giant success and
that's what i did
for a couple of months i woke up every
single day and i read from the beginning
of the day to the end of the day
i went to therapy multiple times a week
i joined free self-help groups and i
found friends on the internet who wanted
to do work with me and i did as much
work as i could
during the time that i had and what
allowed me the permission to do that was
telling myself
not you're failing you're failing you're
failing but you are making
this consequence successful what would
make
this depression this addiction this debt
this loneliness this failed relationship
a success is one of the best questions
you can ask yourself
in order to reframe the difficulties
that you're going through
to help you understand what bigger role
they can play in your life
when you get a headache because you're
dehydrated that headache is a success
if it encourages you to drink water and
rehydrate your body
and the same can be said for a lot of
the emotional symptoms that come up
including
feeling stuck and unmotivated and like
you're spinning your wheels
because they can draw your attention to
the areas that you really need to do
deep work on
in order to come out the other side
heading somewhere better
question number five is a question that
is so
close to my heart because it's the
question that i have not asked myself
for most of my life and i think not
asking myself this question
has almost 100 of the time been the
reason why i've stayed stuck
and this question i believe i stole from
a david white
poem i'm pretty sure that's where i got
it from but it is
what are you holding on to that's
already gone
as an enfp we have introverted sensing
and introverted feeling and those are
two of the damn
most sentimental functions that you can
have in your stacking and we've got them
together
enfps and infps and what that means is
that we have a tendency
to hold on to the memory of good things
long
long long long long long long after they
are gone
and convince ourselves that we can
recreate those things in the future and
they will feel
every bit as good and as exciting and as
interesting as they once did
and that's not how anything works
everything that happens to us in life
happens within a given context and a
given system of other events
and as soon as some of those things
change we can no longer perfectly
recreate the old situation we just can't
do it it's not an option that's
available to us
but because we're not natural systems
thinkers as enfps again introverted
thinking
is in our shadow function stacking it's
not in our dominant stacking and
introverted thinking
really does help think in systems we
tend to take isolated events and go oh
yeah i can recreate that if i can just
do this one thing again if i can just
bring this one thing
from the past into my future it will
feel as good as it did in the past
and there are so many forces working
against us right
but that is our natural impulse is to
cling so tightly to what we love and
what we don't want to lose
and a lot of the time we are clinging
tightly to something
that we no longer even have the capacity
to recreate
even if we put 300 of our energy into it
maybe we could create something similar
but new but we can't recreate the past
that's gone doesn't matter how hard you
deny it the denying of it is only gonna
keep you stuck
and keep you from moving into the future
effectively so maybe
you're in a relationship that once felt
really really amazing and it doesn't
feel so amazing anymore
maybe you are working a job that you
used to feel so inspired by
and passionate about and now it feels
kind of dull and boring
and until you grieve what you've lost
you cannot find a better way forward you
just can't
because you'll still be holding on to
this ghost of what you once had
right you have to let it go you have to
accept
that something once really really really
mattered to you and it's not coming back
in the same form
that relationship might never be as
exciting or as
filled with opportunities as it once was
that job might never feel as
intellectually stimulating or as
successful as it once did
that ghost of what's gone whether it's a
relationship
that's no longer working a job that's no
longer fulfilling
a friend group that you no longer belong
with a phase of your life
that's now past its expiration date
that's taking up room in your
metaphorical stomach
right but it's not actually providing
you any nutritional value
and what happens when you finally allow
yourself to grieve and let go of that
thing and accept that what's gone
is gone and it's not coming back you get
hungry again
you now have a chasm between where you
are
and what you want in your life allowing
yourself to let
go of what's gone gives your psyche
room to welcome in new things because
it's not preserved
by trying to hang on so tightly anymore
and when you have that hunger again
as scary as it is to make room for you
will know the next step forward
because your hunger will tell you where
it wants to go next
you'll know there is this buddhist
system called the five wisdom energies
that's actually kind of like a
personality system
where they talk about these five
different energies that you can have in
your life so there's the energy of
intellect and knowledge and
understanding there's the energy of
exploring and collecting and relishing
and there's all these different types of
energies that you can be in mentally
but the most important energy that you
need to return to over and over again in
your life
is the buddha energy and the buddha
energy sits right in the middle
and it allows you access to all of these
other energies and what the buddha
energy is
is the energy of nothingness of just
allowing yourself to be still
and unmoving and to not grasp for
anything or want for anything
but to just allow there to be space for
other things to emerge inside of your
consciousness
so let's say that you've been really
really focused on achieving on growing
on
personal development and you feel like
you're spinning your wheels okay
stop go back to your buddha energy ask
yourself
what can i let go of what is no longer
serving me maybe it's time to move into
another energy
maybe it's time to refine the energy
that you've been working on maybe it's
time to logically map out a completely
different route forward
but until you're allowing yourself to
sit in that space of stillness
and to humble yourself enough to
recognize what's no longer working for
you
you are going to stay stuck that's a
guarantee
time does not change this you can stay
stuck your whole life
tragedy might come along and force you
into a position of humility
and force you into a situation where you
have to change something because you've
gotten
so deep into the mud that it is now
explicitly clear you can't stay there
but you don't have to let it get that
far
you know when you're stagnating you know
when you're not on the path that you're
meant to be on anymore
because when you're on the path that
you're supposed to be on you will have
the energy for it
you will wake up every morning and be
curious and interested about the day
that's in front of you even when it's
difficult
even when it's unpleasant you'll feel
like this is my kind of unpleasant
right this is the kind of challenge that
i like to take on
even when it feels excruciatingly
difficult it's never going to be easy
all the time but you
know the feeling between a difficult
climb in the right direction
and going nowhere but to figure out what
mountain is next
you sometimes have to descend into the
valley and you know what
it's a great place to be it feels so
much
better than standing at the top of the
mountain wondering why you're so
damn bored of the view i promise you
okay i think that's all i have to say
about that
um this video felt very personal to me
because these are all of the really hard
questions that i've had to ask myself at
times when i would
rather die than answer them
and it wasn't until i went there that
things started really really
really changing for the better in my
life and i'm really curious to hear
what kind of answers these sparked for
you guys if you want to share them in
the comments with me
i would absolutely love to read through
those and just connect with you guys
about
wherever you're at and whatever it is
that you're dealing with and just
another reminder the last project that i
did feel super excited about working on
was the enfp soul bootcamp course that i
created in 2020.
it is a six week program that just
encourages you to really really get in
touch with your inner self
and help you make better decisions and
move forward confidently in the
directions that you actually want to go
in life and that bootcamp program can be
found on my website at www.heidiprev.com
i'll put the link in the description i
also run one for infps that's very very
similar
so if that's speaking to you right now i
will see you there and otherwise i will
see you back here
sometime soon okay
i love you
