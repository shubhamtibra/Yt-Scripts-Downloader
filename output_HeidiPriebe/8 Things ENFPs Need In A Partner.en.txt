hey guys heidi preeb here um i'm in my
new apartment so that's very exciting
it's not super set up yet i also am not
a lifestyle vlogger so i'm probably
never gonna show you any more than this
corner but um this is my filming corner
very exciting
got a fake fireplace and some books in
the background and that's gonna be my
set
for a while um today i wanted to talk
about something
that i was thinking about a lot after a
video that i released a few months ago
which was called i think top 10 mistakes
that enfps make in relationships
and i was getting all these comments by
like people who'd been jaded by enfps or
enfps who were really down on themselves
for making all of these mistakes
and i was thinking about how i wasn't
necessarily
sharing the entire picture because i
think the reason why enfps make a lot of
mistakes in relationships
is because growing up a lot of us don't
really have a model for what someone
like us
needs in a relationship so we're taught
all of these things that don't
necessarily apply
to who we actually are and then we just
go and try to replicate them and then it
doesn't work and then we
put it on ourselves for having failed or
having um
let somebody down and a lot of the time
it's really just that we don't know what
our needs
are in relationships so we don't know
what to look for and i want to address
that in this video so i want to talk a
little bit about
what you need to be looking for as an
enfp going into romantic relationships
because your needs are going to look
different than the needs of the average
person i remember when i started dating
and growing up the dominant kind of
paradigm about relationships was like oh
you should be with someone who
challenges you and that was kind of like
the cool sexy thing to want because it
was like this
feminist ideal is like having a
partnership where you feel challenged
and excited and like a little bit
competitive maybe in some ways
um and i ended up
dating people who were just so unlike me
and had drastically different
interests priorities values than me and
i remember always being like
okay i'm challenged i feel very
challenged so like i must be doing this
right but it feels terrible and i'm not
enjoying my relationships i don't really
feel like myself in them
i don't feel inspired or alive
and i eventually had to realize that
being challenged
is a very subjective term that can mean
a lot of different things
and there are ways i like to be
challenged and ways i don't like to be
challenged at all ways i just like to
totally chill out and relax with my
partner
and that is so fine being an np type
means the world is already kind of
challenging and we also tend to
challenge ourselves in a lot of ways so
you don't necessarily need a partner
who's going to push you to develop and
grow in all of these ways that you might
not necessarily want to grow in and
that's a really really important thing
right off the bat that i think we need
to make clear
another thing i want to address before
we get going is that there is no ideal
type
pairing in mbti everyone wants there to
be like this ideal type who you meet and
you're just gonna click with and
everything's gonna go swimmingly
and i really really don't ascribe to
that notion that that's a thing
there are definitely types who you might
be more predisposed to having a
connection with so it might be a little
bit easier for you because you already
have some kind of mental processes in
common
to find common ground but that doesn't
mean that's going to be the best person
for your development it doesn't mean
that's going to be someone
who you have shared interest with it
doesn't mean it's going to be someone
who shares your lifestyle
preferences and i think a lot of those
things are a lot more important than
pure baseline cognitive compatibility so
i just want to encourage you to keep a
really open mind
as you think about what you want in a
relationship and don't look at mbti as a
predictor of what you want look at mbti
as something that can help you
make a relationship work with whoever
you do end up with because you like them
so now that we've talked about all that
let's talk about some of the things that
you might want to look for in a
relationship as an enfp
to make sure that you're able to fully
and completely be yourself in the
relationship
and bring all of the awesome and unique
gifts that you have into your
relationship
so green flag number one for enfps and
relationships
is someone who is flexible and
open-minded so
leading with dominant extroverted
intuition means that your life is never
going to be perfectly consistent maybe
for
certain stretches of time you want to
kind of hunker down and do one thing
but for the most part over the course of
your life you're going to have
a million different interests a million
different careers you want to pursue and
places you want to travel to and things
that you're really interested in
and well there's something to be said
for sure in a partner that grounds you
you don't want a partner who grounds you
at the expense of you being able to
fully and freely explore the world which
is what your mind
is born to do so i think i've talked a
little bit about this before but there
are these
six core human needs that i think it was
tony robbins who coined them he either
made them up or he just talks about them
a lot oh i got these from tony robbins
but these six core human needs that we
all have to varying degrees and the
needs are
certainty uncertainty slash variety
significance connection and love growth
and contribution
and i think that enfps in particular
have a slightly lower than average need
for certainty
and a slightly higher than average need
for uncertainty and for growth
and what that means is that over the
course of our lives we're going to have
a lot of shifting interests and we
really need a partner
who can support us through that and who
isn't stressed out by that because
someone who let's say has a really
really high need for certainty might
actually feel really threatened by a
partner who's pursuing a lot of
uncertainty or a lot of growth
and well that may feel comforting during
the periods where we're kind of looking
to stabilize
it's not going to work in the long term
if you're looking for a long-term
partnership
it's fine if you're not you're going to
need a partner who's open to a lot of
change
and a lot of different ways of living
and a lot of different things that you
kind of try on and then throw out
and who doesn't feel threatened or
stressed out by that when i was younger
i used to think that the best i could
hope for was a partner who tolerated
my many different shifting interests and
passions and thoughts
and it wasn't until the last couple
years of my life when i realized oh
you can have a partner who actually
encourages you and really really
supports you pursuing all of these
different areas
and it can feel really really exciting
to explore those things with a partner
and i really encourage you if you are an
enfp and you're looking for a
relationship and you've never felt that
way
trust that that's out there pursue that
make sure whoever you're dating is
really open to you pursuing all the
different avenues of life because that
is what you're built to do that's what
you're here to do
and you do not want to limit yourself by
being in a relationship that asks you to
tone that down
thing number two enough he's really
needing relationships high
quality conversation so this is actually
probably my personal
number one like the number one question
i always ask myself when i'm considering
dating someone or getting into a
relationship is could i
die talking to this person like do i see
myself waking up in 50 or 60 years
and looking over at this person and
being like wow we still have so much to
say to each other we still have so much
to explore and it is not about
how much or what that person knows it's
not about where their area of expertise
is
it's about their sense of wonder
intellectually
so when i'm looking for someone who i
connect with on that level i'm not
looking for the person in the room with
the most information in their brain i'm
looking for the most curious person in
the room the person who
is constantly fascinated by everyday
things who is constantly looking to
learn and grow and expand their own
skill set and their own knowledge base
someone who's able to flip over a whole
bunch of different intellectual rocks
with me and just look at what's
underneath and
be curious and excited about learning
and growing together
the ability to be really mindful about
the life that they're living
and the ability to observe their life in
a way that is
complex and nuanced and in depth
is absolutely without question the
single most important thing to me and i
think
probably to a lot of enfps so any likes
to go wide and then
fi likes to go deep and if you can find
a conversation partner who can do both
of those things with you
and that doesn't have to mean that
they're using the same functions it
could be actually very fascinating
to find someone who uses completely
different functions than you but who can
go to those places with you and provide
new perspectives
that's a really really good sign that
your relationship is probably
a lot higher on the natural
compatibility scale than a lot of other
relationships might be
thing number three that i think enfps
really really need in relationship
is the ability to be fun and
lighthearted and silly with their
partner
so enfps are kind of known for being um
very kind of like goofy and funny and
out there
but i think internally we have this very
serious side so that's why we need those
quality conversations we need that
ability to go out and explore new things
and new topics
but we don't want things to be serious
all the time and i think a lot of enfps
are really guilty
for really liking intensity in people
like we're drawn to very
either emotionally or intellectually
intense people and then what happens is
a lot of us get in these relationships
where we're very intellectually engaged
but the kind of fun and excitement
slowly drains out of our lives i've had
that happen to me i've seen it happen to
other enfps
and i think it's really important to
note that you need someone you can laugh
with who doesn't take themselves or life
100
seriously and who knows how to cheer you
up when you're having a rough time
because
again enfps tend to lead with their
extroverted fun
bubbly side but we have very deep and
very intense emotions and we can get
stuck in those rats and we can get stuck
in those negative thought loops
and if you have a partner who's able to
help you see the light-hearted side of
things when you're in that place
that's something we really need when
we're feeling dark or heavy or
existentially distressed
is a reminder that you can still find
joy in life and you can find humor in
everyday scenarios and that we don't
have to take everything
so so so seriously and i think that a
lot of us are very used to being that
person for other people
but it's really refreshing when we find
a person who can also do that for us and
who shares our sense of humor and who
can bring that side of us out of us
when we're not naturally in touch with
it so that's something that i think a
lot of us don't naturally seek
out but that we really should consider
when we're choosing a partner because
life is very long and if you are with
someone
if you can't laugh with through life it
gets really really
hard but it doesn't have to be thing
number four i would encourage
every enfp to look for in a relationship
is mutual autonomy so i had this as two
separate points originally like i was
like
a partner who's autonomous and then a
partner who is comfortable with us being
autonomous and then i realized that's
just kind of
two sides of the same coin so enfps are
very very independent we're very social
people we are very
passionate people we like to go out and
pursue a lot of different things and
pursue a lot of change and new
experiences
and we need a partner who is comfortable
with that this is very similar
to point number one but we also need a
partner who has their own sense of
autonomy because
a lot of enfps are not naturally great
at setting boundaries and that's
absolutely something that we need to
work on that's a skill that we owe it to
ourselves and to other people to develop
consciously and purposefully but it
really helps us out if we find a partner
who already has a natural sense of
boundaries and who already has a lot of
their own interests a lot of their own
things that they're pursuing a lot of
their own ideas and plans
because we don't want to find ourselves
taking on too much of another person's
stuff we are very good cheerleaders and
we're very good at motivating people and
we're very good at seeing the best in
people and encouraging people to develop
towards their best and most authentic
self
but we don't want to have to do that we
want to be in a supporting role
for someone who already has a lot of
their own stuff going on and i think
it's
very common for a lot of younger enfps
and i very much fell into this trap when
i was in my early 20s
to find someone who we see as kind of a
project and be like okay i see this
person's potential and i could push them
towards it
but that's not sustainable long term if
someone doesn't have their own natural
sense of motivation and autonomy it's
going to be really really hard for us to
serve as that person's
fuel they need their own sense of self
which
actually leads me to my next point which
is point number five
we need to look for someone who has a
very strong sense of self and who will
not let us put them on a pedestal
and again this is something where we
really need to work on it so
enfps have this tendency to idealize
people to put them on pedestals and then
to be disappointed
when the person doesn't match up to that
pedestal in reality and that is 100
on you as an enfp if this is a trait
that you have most of us go through it
especially when we're younger once again
we actually talk a lot about this in the
enfp soul bootcamp program that i run
there's an entire module that's just
dedicated to
helping you figure out how to take
people off pedestals and actually engage
with them
as a entire and complex human being who
is standing in front of you with their
own
interests and thoughts and biases and
past traumas and experiences that are
different than yours
and it sounds funny but it's a very real
problem that a lot of enfps have is
really favoring the idealized version of
someone that they have in their head
over the person that's actually standing
in front of them in the flesh and blood
but because there are certain people who
i think like to be told a little bit
more
what to do and how to act and how to
behave um who don't have as strong or
has developed a sense of self
there can be this really disastrous trap
that happens if an enfp
links up with a person like that and the
enfp will try to kind of
mold this person into who they're
fantasizing them to be
and you really need to be with the
person who will not go along with that
who understands their own boundaries
very clearly and who can tell you no
this is not me
i can't do this for you i can't be this
person for you but here's who i am
and if you want to love that person
that's great and of course there are
always reasonable compromises but you
should never be asking someone to
compromise their sense of self
and their personal identity to fit a
mold that you want them to fit into
because that's really not going to be
healthy for you or for them long term
number six is one i debated on a little
bit but i really do think it applies
someone who doesn't want to prioritize
the material over the experiential part
of life
and where this really comes into play i
think is when you enter into a long-term
relationship you want to start a family
with someone
and you become very financially
interdependent
and a lot of the decisions about where
to live and how you want to spend your
excess money if you want to go on
vacation or if you want to reinvest in
education or whatever it is
when you look at how you spend your
resources in alignment with another
person you have to make sure you're
fairly aligned in terms of what's
important to you and what your core
values are and where i see nfps get into
trouble
is when they find a partner who they
might find grounds them quite a bit
maybe because they're a lot more
practical than they are but then there
becomes this giant mismatch with how
they want to spend their resources so as
an enfp
we're always going to naturally value
the experiential
and the opportunities to learn and grow
and expand our horizons over kind of
creature comforts and that's just a
virtue of our personality type we are
intuitive dominant types and sensing is
our dead last function
and i think it can be very challenging
for enfps who end up
with people who really value the
material over the experiential so who
really want to get the bigger house
instead of take that trip every year who
really want to
send their kids to the most expensive
school instead of pushing their kids to
pursue alternate routes of education
and it's not that those things can't be
worked out and it's not that compromises
can't be made
but i think that when you're working
with a fundamental difference in values
it can be really really hard to resolve
because certain things just feel very
instinctually comforting to enfps versus
to other types
and those things really need to be
addressed early on so when you're
looking for a partner
look at how do they spend their time how
do they spend their resources
and what feels very intuitively
important to this person so just being
aware of those things early and being
aware of how you like to spend your
resource
versus how someone else likes to spend
theirs might save you a lot of heartache
down the road
and a lot of really really difficult
conversations and negotiations
trait number seven that i really
encourage us to look for in partners as
enfps
is someone who's not threatened by our
social circle so enfps
um can have this tendency to like zoom
in on their partner and want to stay
really really focused on the
relationship because it's so intense and
you're getting so much connection out of
it
but when we are at our healthiest we are
super social people
with really big social circles and we
need a lot of different relationships to
give us different perspectives
and keep us healthy and balanced and
feeling like our full selves
and if we have a partner who feels very
threatened they're not comfortable with
us having
a large circle of friends a large circle
of acquaintances
constantly pursuing new relationships in
different forms with
obviously respectful boundaries in place
that's going to be really difficult for
us to mitigate because
it's going to be really really
challenging for us to feel like our full
and entire selves
without that very active social life and
our partner needs to be someone who
again has enough autonomy and enough
self-confidence and enough of their own
stuff going on to feel really really
comfortable
with us having a very active and engaged
community and ideally our partner maybe
even wants to be a part of that and
wants to get to know our friends and get
to know our family and can also
introduce us to awesome new people in
their life so that's not to say we need
to be with a raging extrovert i know a
lot of enfps feel really comfortable
around introverts
but we need to be with someone who feels
very very comfortable with and happy
watching us shine in our own social
circles so in this video we've talked a
lot about what we need from other people
but i also want to quickly address what
we have to give
and offer people and that brings me to
my last point which is that we need a
partner
who is excited about growth enfps are
built to encourage to cheerlead to see
the best in people and encourage them to
work towards that best
and if we're in a relationship where
someone doesn't want that where maybe
growth is very low on their own
list of needs or interests it's going to
be really hard for us to give what we
are naturally born to give in a
relationship which is that encouragement
which is that
exploration of different models and
different frames of understanding and
different perceptions
and if we can't offer that to someone
and have them receive it
it's going to feel like our gifts are
being kind of wasted in that
relationship
it's really important not to compromise
on this one not to tell yourself i can
take a partner who has a very fixed
mindset and change them
and push them to be different than they
are it's gonna work out
best for you if you find a partner who's
already very
oriented towards growth and change and
challenging themselves in new ways you
don't have to challenge each other
you need to find someone who likes to
challenge themselves as much as you like
to challenge
yourself and then the amount of growth
you can do as a couple
fusing that energy is incredible
and that's really something that i just
wish for all enfps because it took me
27 years of my own life to find the
first relationship that i really felt
like
i am encouraged to grow within i see
incredible growth opportunities for my
partner that they're all so excited
about
and we are two autonomous beings
bringing out the best in each other i
didn't know that was an option
i really did think for the longest time
in my life relationships are just
supposed to be really
limiting and constraining and confining
and they don't have to be
any of those things so i think the
number one
piece of advice i would give for all
enfps as extroverted intuitive dominant
types who just want to go out and
explore and discover
and find the best that they can in every
situation
is find someone with whom a relationship
feels like it's opening more doors for
you then it's closing
okay a relationship should not be the
thing that keeps you trapped or confined
or keeps you from working on yourself it
should be something that opens more
doors and
offers more possibilities and gives you
more roots and more perspectives through
which you can explore the world
both intellectually and physically and
don't worry about
just hanging out and waiting for a
really long time until that happens for
you
um if we're not comfortable with
ourselves we're not ever going to be
comfortable with someone else and first
we really have to figure out how to do
all of the stuff i just talked about
for ourselves outside of a relationship
but that's something
we're going to talk a lot more about
because coming up i'm going to do a
series on enfps and attachment
styles so i'm going to cross-reference
the enfp type with every different
attachment style and talk about
what that might look like and which kind
of flavors that gives each enfp based on
what their attachment style is
um if you don't know what attachment
styles are i have a bunch of videos on
it so you can find those on my channel
and last thing before we go i just
wanted to remind you guys if you are an
enfp or if you know or love an enfp
i run six weeks soul boot camp programs
they're currently on the self study
program on my website which means you
can go there
and access the course at your own pace
you have six weeks worth of video
content but again you can do it all on
day one or you can do it over the course
of a year
whatever works for you we talk about
lots of things from emotional
intelligence to
cognitive development to relationships
for the enfp
but once again you can go to my website
at www.heidipreeb.com
and find out much more about all of that
there i think that's it for today's
video i love you guys i missed you i'm
going to see
a lot more of you now that i'm all set
up in my new place and we
will talk again soon
