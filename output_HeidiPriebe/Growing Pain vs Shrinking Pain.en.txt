one of the most important distinctions
you will ever learn to make in your life
is the distinction between growing pain
and shrinking pain
shrinking pain is the pain of trying to
limit and contort and Shrink yourself
into the places that you just don't
belong it feels like you are limiting
and keeping yourself away from your
potential
right growing pain is the pain of
expanding into a bigger greater version
of yourself so it feels like the pain of
stumbling and messing up and
strengthening yourself on route to
fulfilling your potential and when you
learn to distinguish between these two
types of pain you learn to distinguish
the paths that are going to grow you
into the best possible versions of
yourself from the paths that are going
to keep you stuck
