all right we are booting up just on time
does everyone remember what their jobs
are
i'm to make sure the internet is
functioning properly and take notes
about what to follow up on for the next
meeting
i'm to provide a whole bunch of fun
engaging ideas so that the client thinks
we care
i am to shut up if i you don't have to
shut up you just have to
manage my emotions in a way that is
appropriate
appropriate to the situation and
and don't fall in love with anyone wait
why can't our clients fall in love with
us that's just good business sense
when i fall in love i get weird and then
the enfp stops thinking right
you guys are getting on everyone be cool
polite chit chat time
i'm on it i personally feel drained like
emotionally from this experience
it's like i can't express myself does
anyone else feel like they can't express
themselves this is actually the only
time i can express myself
it really helps if you just zone out and
let s i and te take over
oh we're negotiating i love this part
i think we should price our services at
five maximum
six dollars yes because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] capitalism
also it'll make them like us so i'm just
gonna go ahead and add
three zeros behind that number t e
that seems like too much you know we
could go to france on that money
i have always wanted to see the
vineyards in the south of france
oh wow they accept it all right i
am going to go ahead and get crazy
perfectionistic about everything i do
for the next four weeks
are you gonna do that thing where you
tell the enfp that she's dying every
time she feels like a slight tinge of
pain in her body
nice sometimes i picture the enfp's
funeral just like watching it as a ghost
because everyone would say super nice
things about us and also all of her exes
would be sorry
okay guys we just have to hold it
together for four more minutes
can we hold it together for four more
minutes i have to pee
what if we moved to the forest and just
never did another zoom call
ever again where would we get food
okay we're wrapping up so i have tasks
for everyone to do
immediately after this meeting s i
you're going to send a calendar
invite to the client for the next
meeting annie you're going to brainstorm
ideas for how we're going to handle this
project
fi you're just going to repress yourself
as much as humanly possible until this
project is over does everyone
understand sure boss i'm
on it
all right and break okay great thank you
so much
