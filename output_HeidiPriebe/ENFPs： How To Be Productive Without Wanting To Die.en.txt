hey guys heidi preep here i am here
today to do
a bit of a monster of a video i think i
just kind of like feel it in my bones
that it's going to be a long one about a
topic that enfps want to know about
constantly which is enfps and
productivity
so i have a lot of thoughts on this
where do we start
so because there was a time period where
basically i was writing like three
articles a day on mbti
and i also wrote i think like five books
in the span of two years
i'm frequently accused in the mbti
community of having
abnormally strong extroverted thinking
for an enfp
and if you don't know what i mean when i
say extraverted thinking i'm talking
about
cognitive functions so your brain as an
enfp is made up of extroverted intuition
introverted feeling extroverted thinking
and introverted sensing and extroverted
thinking is the function that we
stereotypically associate with being
really organized
and getting a lot of stuff done it
really helps us set goals and we're
consistently towards them
and here's the thing as much as i would
love to say that i have an abnormal
amount of te as an enfp
i really don't think that's true i think
that the secret to being hyper
productive as an enfp
is working with yourself holistically so
taking into account the fact that you
are not an estj or an entj and hyper
structuring your life is actually
probably going to work against you
rather than with you because it's going
to block your natural creative flow so
in this video i'm not going to be
talking about how to hyper structure
your life
in a way that's going to make you kind
of die inside while you're producing
work
i'm going to talk more about how to keep
your mind and body and spirit
open to new ideas and new experiences
and new opportunities
because that's going to be what makes
you want to produce
okay nobody has a motivation problem i
really deeply to the core of myself
believe that there's no such thing
as an unmotivated person there's only
people whose life conditions do not
match their natural
sense of motivation so this video is
more about designing your life
conditions so that your natural sense of
creativity and motivation will flow out
of you
without you having to be super super
strict with yourself in a way that feels
really constraining
so we're actually gonna go over each of
the four cognitive functions and what
each one of them needs in order to find
the balance between
absolute chaos and extreme rigidity
because in the middle of that is this
beautiful flow state where you can
produce really wonderful work
so in this video i'm gonna assume that
you have some sort of flexibility over
your calendar so if you work a job where
every minute of your life is super
scheduled
a lot of this advice might not work that
well or you might not be able to take it
but assuming that you have some sort of
autonomy over how you structure your
time
this video is going to give you some
tools for how you can use that time
effectively so let's start with
extraverted intuition or
any i could take up a career in film
cameras are an excellent metaphor for
the passage of time
i could be an astrophysicist sure are a
lot of conspiracy theories out there
about stephen hawking
how about that snack any is the part of
your brain that naturally
cross-contextualizes information
and likes to look at things through a
theoretical lens extroverted intuition
is the water that you swim in as an enfp
and if that water is polluted
then you're not gonna have a healthy
outcome and if that water is clean and
filtered and
optimized for your life conditions
you're gonna find it a lot easier to be
creative and productive so having
healthy extroverted intuition even
though i just compared it to like an
ocean
now we're gonna switch gears and talk
about it like it's a farm so if you
study farming for like three seconds
which i assume many of you have because
you're people with diverse interests
you'll quickly find out that
biodiversity is really really important
for growing healthy crops so the more
organisms that you have contributing to
one plot of land
the better your crops are ultimately
going to grow and the healthier crops
you're going to produce and the same is
true of your brain as an enfp or an entp
because our brain naturally likes to
cross-contextualize information
the first thing that you need to do is
make sure you are
feeding your brain a bio-diverse range
of information
if you are feeling slow and unproductive
and unmotivated it's probably not
because you have an output issue it's
because you have an
input issue okay if you're not watering
your soils if you're not keeping your
farmland alive
there's gonna be nothing growing there
you need to look at the conditions that
you're putting your mind
in so are you doing a lot of reading on
different interests are you talking to a
range of different people are you
engaging with a lot of novelty
are you switching things up regularly in
your life all of these
practices of bringing new ideas into our
awareness
is what ultimately leads to those aha
moments for us as enfps where we figure
something out that before felt kind of
hazy and difficult to reach
healthy extroverted intuition literally
just means
taking a whole bunch of different
thoughts that are maybe slightly related
but slightly different
throwing them all in your brain letting
them mix and mingle in there for a while
until those thoughts start figuring out
for themselves oh
i'm kind of similar to this thought but
not so similar to this thought what's
the differences and similarities
that is the cross-contextual thinking
that your brain
naturally thrives on it loves to figure
out what's the same what's different
and then it can isolate different
variables to figure out like ah this is
my one pearl of wisdom right
this is the thing that's like this but
not like this and once you arrive at
that pearl of wisdom and understanding
you're gonna be naturally motivated to
draw upon it to share it to do more
research on it
but first you have to give yourself a
bio diverse range of information
in order to grow that beautiful crop out
of if you're not
feeding your brain you're not going to
produce anything good
99 of the time when i'm feeling really
unproductive and i'm really struggling
it's because i'm not
learning anything trying to be
productive as an enfp if you're not
actively engaged in ongoing education is
exactly like trying to grow
farm crops without any rain or any soil
it's just not going to work because the
conditions are not right for it
you wouldn't beat up a tomato plant for
not growing if it wasn't being watered
or it didn't have the proper conditions
to foster and you would just change its
environment
and the same is true for you and your
brain if you're not producing if you're
not thriving if you're not meeting your
full potential
look at your environment ask yourself
what you're putting into your mind
before you get down on yourself for what
you're pulling out of it okay if your
brain isn't growing vegetables it's
probably not because you're lazy you
probably just need to give your brain
crops some water the number two tip that
i would give for enfps who want to
become more productive
is actually one that comes from the
comprehensive enfp survival guide but
not one
that i wrote so when i was writing this
book let me grab it actually one sec
so when i was writing this book in like
2015 or whatever
i sent out a survey and asked enfps what
advice they would give to other enfps
and then put a bunch of that advice in
the book
and one thing that someone said was
still to this day
one of the best pieces of advice i've
heard for productivity as an enfp so i'm
gonna find it and read it to you guys
okay so this person wrote
the reason you can't plan an essay the
way others do isn't because your mind
goes blank
but because it thinks of too much at
once and explodes in all directions
get a sheet of paper or a blank screen
and write down all of it even the stupid
stuff that seems completely irrelevant
it's far
easier to rearrange from something than
from nothing start in the middle
work backwards forwards and sideways
because if you try to start at the
beginning you'll never get
any work done at all and i think that is
seriously one of the best pieces of
advice i have ever heard
because what they're suggesting you do
is start from your extroverted intuition
so start from that part of yourself
that feels naturally energized and work
with the big ideas
first then afterwards find the structure
for those ideas it's easier to tame a
fire than it is to try to spark one that
isn't there
start with what you feel really excited
about pursuing
and then work backwards from there and
we're gonna talk a little bit about that
when we get
to the te section of this video but for
now i think that it's really important
to note that you have to honor your
natural process
as soon as you feel compelled to start
working on something because you get
that surge of excitement
don't wait until you have all the steps
in order start there and then try to
tame the fire afterwards it's going to
be a lot more manageable because you're
going to already have something to work
with if you try to start at the
beginning you're going to be doing a lot
of detail-oriented work
that's going to cause you to lose steam
before you ever get to that burst of
inspiration
i have been centralizing my work
philosophy around this particular piece
of advice
for five years now and i promise you it
is
much much much better than trying to do
things the traditional sj way
it's the way that works for you and that
kind of makes it your superpower so own
it
okay so the last piece of extroverted
intuition advice that i'm going to give
is one that i see in a lot of books on
productivity and i think is particularly
applicable for people who have an
extroverted intuition or extroverted
sensing dominant function
is learn to productively procrastinate
so the big problem with procrastination
is that it often comes paired with a lot
of shame and shame
is a very inhibiting emotion right we're
going to talk a lot more in a minute
about how our emotional experience
impacts our ability to be productive
but what shame activates in us is this
feeling of like oh
i want to shrink down inside of myself
and hide from the world and that is the
opposite
of productive energy right one of the
most valuable things i think you can do
as an enfp
and we're going to talk again more about
this as we get to the si section
is start to develop some mindfulness
around when it's just not a good time
for you to focus on the thing that
you're trying to focus on
and choose something else to do instead
so rather than sitting in front of a
computer screen for three hours trying
to write if you're feeling full of
anxiety and you just don't feel like you
have writing in you
at that point in time get up clean your
kitchen
do something that takes your mind in a
different direction
but that puts you in motion somehow
action
begets action okay it's an upward spiral
but inaction and stress and shame
begets inaction and stress and shame so
the more that you sit there and beat
yourself up over what you're not doing
the more you're encouraging yourself to
continue not doing anything
versus if you are to call a spade a
spade tell yourself i'm not
focused on this right now my any wants
to think about or explore something else
pick something that's going to put you
in motion that's going to start some
sort of
upward spiral where you start to feel
like oh i could be productive even if
it's in this other department i once
wrote an entire course when i was
procrastinating writing something else
and guess what that course ended up
becoming a lot more useful in my life
than the other thing that i was trying
to do in the first place
and the important piece here is just try
to pick something that isn't like
off and watching tv right pick
something that's going to make you feel
good about yourself
so whether that's exercising whether
that's cleaning or even just calling a
friend and talking through
any anxiety or resistance you're feeling
towards the work that you're supposed to
be doing
is gonna go a much longer way than
sitting there beating yourself up for
hours because you're not getting the
work that you want to get done
done just take some small action in some
area and it's going to put your brain in
motion it's going to kick you into the
gear you need to be kicked into
in order to start working effectively
all right time to
talk about your next cognitive function
which is introverted feeling
hey hey fi
oh sorry i didn't see you there geez
what were you doing you're supposed to
be answering emails
i was having a fantasy about how
misunderstood i am obviously
i also forget where this quote comes
from so forgive me it might be a gabor
mate quote it just kind of feels like
the kind of thing he'd say
but i remember reading somewhere this
line that was like
most people who think that they have a
time management problem
actually have an emotion management
problem and i was like oh
oh no yep yep that's it
and i'm gonna say i don't think that all
enfps
struggle with emotional regulation i
think a lot of enfps have very healthy
relationships to their fi where they're
able to
deal with emotions authentically as they
come up they're able to address them
they're able to be compassionate towards
themselves
they have a secure attachment but i
think that the venn diagram
of enfps who really really struggle with
productivity
and enfps who have emotional regulation
issues
kind of looks like this i really think
that it is
more often than not anxiety negative
self-talk
perfectionism inner critic and
self-esteem or worthiness issues
that are the main components of what
gets in our way when it comes to doing
work
now this could be untrue if let's say
you're dealing with something like
attention deficit disorder where you
really really have trouble sequencing
your actions and with gauging how much
time things take etc etc
by the way if you do have adhd or you
think you might have it i really
recommend the book scattered minds by
gabor mate i'm reading it right now and
it is
a fascinating perspective on adhd also
if you're not an enfp and you have adhd
or know someone or love someone who has
it
it's just a really really cool
perspective on how attachment and trauma
and early childhood experiences play
into the later development of adhd
and how adhd can be managed in a more
holistic way
anyway i don't have adhd i just feel the
need to disclose that because i want to
acknowledge that that could be an
additional layer of challenge that
you're dealing with on top of
kind of enfp specific concentration
issues but even without it
i really think that for myself the main
thing that gets in my own way is all of
those things i just mentioned it's often
not that i don't know what work needs to
be done
it's that i'm distracted by thoughts or
negative emotions that i'm having and
those things are demanding my attention
so the best strategy i've ever come up
with as a self-employed person
is baking self-care into my work day and
making it
non-negotiable i remember reading one
time if you don't have time to exercise
you don't have time to do your work day
and i really really ascribe to that
philosophy every single day i do an hour
to an hour and a half of exercise
before sitting down to work and if i do
not do that
my productivity is insanely insanely
lower exercise boosts endorphin levels
endorphin levels help with concentration
for other people it's meditating first
thing in the morning that helps for
other people it's calling someone and
just having some social interaction that
helps but you have to look at your
emotional well-being
as an absolute core component
of your work life and your ability to
produce if you ever want to produce
consistently okay if you wait until
you're feeling good
to produce good work it's probably going
to work you're going to work in extreme
bursts and flops and that's fine for
some people that works and you can live
your whole life like that and that's
totally cool i really really encourage
you to do whatever works for you
but if you have any sort of job where
you need a consistent level of output
you have to pay extreme attention to
what you need for self-care
and you have to make it a part of your
work day so i'm not allowed to sign off
for the day
until i have done an hour and a half of
exercise i'm not allowed to sign off for
the day until i've journaled and checked
in with my inner child
and it sounds ridiculous but when i tell
you
that this allows me to consistently
produce
in a way that absolutely nothing else
does i
promise you i promise you i am not lying
you are a complex system in and of
yourself right
just like a company has to manage the
emotions and circumstances of all of its
employees
you have to manage the emotions and
circumstances of your inner world
in order to create a smooth and
comfortable working environment
where you're not constantly distracted
by racing thoughts that you haven't
dealt with
you might need to get therapy you might
need to do years of trauma work before
you can sit down and focus for hours at
a time without interruption
that's fine develop an awareness of that
and don't minimize your emotional
experience
and tell it you shouldn't be showing up
because i'm trying to concentrate it's
like a little child it's going to keep
tugging on your sleeve until you give it
a tension
and believe me once you've listened to
it and integrated it
it will leave you alone for long enough
to get stuff done next tip for
integrating introverted feeling into
your work day
so if you've been in the personality
world for a little while you've probably
heard about the study that the quiet
institute came out with
where they talked about how extroverts
favor the neurotransmitter dopamine in
their brain
introverts tend to favor the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is
the chief neurotransmitter of your
parasympathetic nervous system
otherwise known as your kind of power
down or rest and digest system and what
acetylcholine specializes in
is memory concentration focus
being able to kind of blur out your
environment and really deeply hone in on
one thing at a time
and absolutely every single extrovert
and
every single introvert uses both of
these neurotransmitters
constantly frequently all the time
dopamine is the chemical in our brain
that causes
us to anticipate environmental rewards
and go after them
as an enfp you are naturally very good
at that
but we might be a little more inclined
as extroverts to get distracted by those
kind of dopamine rewards
and to not spend as much time in that
kind of deeply focused flow state
but a lot of the time that's the state
we need to be in in order to produce
work
so what you need to do is find ways to
start getting that acetylcholine flowing
through your body
before you start working so what a lot
of us do is we sit down to work
and we're feeling scattered and our
minds in a million different directions
and we're like okay now it's time to
focus
it's already too late by that point okay
your mind already doesn't want to work
it's already firing in a million
different directions
what you need to do is find a way to
focus your attention before you sit down
to work
so this means finding a non-intimidating
way
to kind of hypnotize yourself a little
bit and put yourself in a flow state
figure out what holds your attention
naturally so for me
every single morning i go for a long
walk and i listen to an audiobook
that naturally focuses my attention in
on one thing i'm listening to the
author's voice
and trying to make sense of what they're
saying and by the time i sit down to
work i'm in a deeply focused state
because i
took something that captured my
attention and i allowed it to put me
into that mode where i'm focused
i'm digesting information i'm trying to
remember what i've learned and now i'm
showing up to my work day with my system
already wired towards focused attention
so i don't know what it's going to be
for you that puts you in that deeply
focused state but it has to be something
that you like
doing okay it's kind of like when you
crush up a pill and put it in your dog's
dog food
you have to do that with your own
concentration like find an activity that
you really enjoy that helps you keep
your focus
and then just kind of slide your
transition into the workday into there
before your brain really notices what's
happening maybe it's sitting down and
watching a ted talk every morning maybe
it's doing morning pages which is a
technique that a book called the
artist's way suggests for writers it's
basically just sitting down every
morning and writing for a set period of
time or for a set number of pages
and just letting your brain work out
whatever it needs to work out in those
pages in a completely unstructured way
and the idea is it helps you focus your
attention in
focusing your attention before it needs
to be focused
is the perfect way to acclimatize
yourself to the workday
without going into shock because you're
trying to switch from a scattered mode
into a deeply focused one do yourself a
favor and do that in a way that you like
so that it doesn't feel like a chore to
focus when you have to
it feels like a natural extension of the
energy that you're already in
okay here's the one we've all been
waiting for extraverted thinking all
right
it is 901 am and we have already
showered gotten through our to-do list
gotten settled into a workflow may even
be time for me to take a rest and let
some of the other functions work
t look at me look at me t okay any i'm
looking what do you want
two words i have a feeling this is gonna
upset the workflow extroverted thinking
is the part of your brain that does like
to organize
set goals put things in a logical
sequence achieve
right and this is definitely a function
that we do have to harness to an extent
if we want to be producing any sort of
work in a way that is consistent first
piece of advice i'm going to give about
te is just something that works really
well for me personally
so i am before all else an author and
right now i'm currently writing a book
and the number one thing that i have
found
keeps me sane when i'm taking on a large
project like that
is having a very specific structure for
what i'm going to do so that i don't
have to worry about the steps trying to
create
anything without structure is like
trying to get water to flow into the
ocean
without having a riverbend to direct it
it's just gonna scatter everywhere and
seep into the ground
and that's what your attention is going
to do if you don't have structure for
that attention to flow inside of
every time i sit down to write a book
chapter i start with what is the
question
that this chapter is asking and what
answer am i leading people to
and then i look at the logical sequence
of thoughts that might eventually
lead to that answer and i write those
down as subtitles
and then i'll go through and think about
how many paragraphs approximately i want
to put under each subtitle
and i'll write out the theme of each
paragraph this paragraph is introducing
the idea
this paragraph is giving some examples
of the idea this paragraph is explaining
the limits of the idea
and naturally flowing into the next
section if i did not do that
i would have zero books written i'm a
hundred percent sure of that
extroverted intuition will run wild and
try to write a single book that covers
every topic on earth if we do not give
our ideas very specific
boundaries to flow within and then you
can get creative with the content and
you can change
and redirect the river flow as much as
you need to once you get going
but first you have to give yourself a
little bit of a structure to stay within
or else you're just gonna get
overwhelmed by the storm that is your
mind
okay we need to give that water
somewhere to go so with any big project
that you're taking on it's the oldest
advice in the book but you have to break
it down into small manageable chunks
and you have to start with the structure
and again if you find the structure
isn't working later on that's totally
fine but it's easier to switch from
strategy
a to strategy b than it is to try to
take the entire alphabet and organize it
all at once
start with the end goal what question
are you answering
find the structure that supports that
end goal
and then let your creative energy come
in at that point and a good time to do
this might be immediately after you've
done that kind of extroverted intuition
thought dump right so if you already
took the start in the middle advice
that's perfect
sit down write out all your thoughts
begin with where you're excited
and then look at what you have and go
okay where do i need to implement
structure to now
further direct this and get the idea or
concept kind of tightened up and the
more you get in the practice of doing
that the easier it will be to start
setting that structure up from the
get-go
now the next piece of advice comes from
atomic habits which i think i've
referenced in several videos now it's
just such a good
book for enfps because it's basically
the study of introverted sensing
for people who don't really like
introverted sensing that's us
but there's a part of this book atomic
habits by james clear where he says that
a big problem with productivity is not
that we don't know what we'll do it's
that we don't know
when we'll do it so they've done all of
these studies where for example there'll
be two groups of people
who really want to start working out and
one group will just repeat to themselves
positive affirmations of i'm going to
work out i'm going to get a lot of
exercising done this week
the other group will write out and
submit a plan of exactly when and for
how long they're going to exercise and
that group is significantly more likely
to actually do the exercise
because they took this idea of what they
wanted to do
and that could be exercise it could be a
work project it could be anything that
you want to get done
and it takes it from the realm of fun
fantasy i'm having somewhere out there
and brings it down and grounds it in the
reality of your actual life
as enfps we have a very big
problem with living in reality we love
to live in our minds we love to swim in
ideas and possibilities
and we are not naturally great at making
those theoretical possibilities a
reality that we're actually engaging
with and this strategy
of just telling yourself when exactly
you're going to do something
and what the first step is going to be
will be monstrously helpful
in setting a workday out for yourself so
often the problem is that we have this
grand idea of maybe something we'd like
to do
and we have that fi emotional fantasy of
how it's going to feel when we're doing
that thing
but we don't have a real life reality
plan
of when we're going to do that thing and
what the first steps are going to be
and when i say first steps i really mean
first steps
i don't mean planning out the first
chapter of your book
i mean putting on comfortable clothes to
write in
and sitting down at your desk and
opening your computer okay
we often think of the first step as the
first thing we're gonna do when we're
already producing or when we're already
working towards our goal
but the first step is the thing that
puts us in motion
the way that i discovered to force
myself to weight train three times a
week i have like a home gym that i set
up during covid
i was having a really hard time
consistently exercising because i would
just tell myself i'm gonna exercise
tomorrow
and it would be two o'clock and i'd be
like oh i'll exercise before dinner
and then it would be six o'clock and i'd
be like oh now it's getting a bit
late i really want to eat i'll exercise
after dinner and then after dinner all
of a sudden it would be 9 30 because i
like to make really complicated meals
and then i'd be too tired and i'd be
like okay i'll exercise tomorrow and i
would do this day after day after day
and then i discovered a hack which is if
i do not let myself
eat dinner until i exercise i will
absolutely exercise
so i really like to slow roast
vegetables my favorite thing to do is
just leave veggies in the oven for like
an hour with a bunch of spices and let
them really seep in
and i discovered if i create a sequence
for myself
where i take my veggies spice them all
up put them in the oven
and put a one hour timer on my phone
because that's when the veggies will be
done
and tell myself you can't eat until
you've worked out i will absolutely work
out in that hour
because now there's a sequence in my
mind i want to do a 55 minute workout
if i have one hour before my dinner is
ready because i don't want to eat a cold
dinner that means i have five minutes
to go put on my gym clothes pick up my
weights and start doing my exercise so
now there's a very clear sequence in my
head
every monday wednesday and friday
sometime between six and eight pm
i do a one-hour workout and i know it's
time to work out when i close the oven
door
that's my first step in my sequence oven
door closes i put my timer on
five minutes to get to my room put on my
workout clothes come back out to the
living room 55 minutes to exercise timer
goes off carrots are ready time to eat
the first step
is not picking up the weight the first
step is putting salt on the carrots
it's a sequence that has time
constraints around it that sets a series
of events in motion
so you have to figure out your sequence
that sets your series of events in
motion
in order to start any sort of routine
okay the first step is not you doing the
action
it's you preparing to do the action that
part is really really really
important so figure out what that
inciting incident is for you
and then find a way to recreate it every
month or two i have a day where i just
wake up and i know in my bones i'm gonna
write all day
and the way i know it in my bones is
because i wake up and i don't want to
check my phone i open my laptop and
immediately start writing
and i know every day that i wake up and
start writing when i'm already in bed is
gonna be a day
where i am so immersed in my work that
the outside world just fades away
and so now if i really need to recreate
that situation because let's say i have
a deadline coming up
i know that i can wake up not check my
phone open my laptop and i'm
creating the conditions that trigger my
brain to think oh today is a writing day
right so this can start with you reverse
engineering
what you naturally do to get yourself
focused motivated productive
figure out what thought puts your brain
in that mode and then
create it artificially so that you can
replicate it when you need to
and this brings me to our last cognitive
function introverted sensing listen
any well you were uh protesting elephant
cruelty
in thailand because uh
a stranger at a bar told you to go there
i just took the liberty of going through
your history
and drawing up a few graphs that i
thought might help us both understand
how to move you a little closer to your
wellness goals
so introverted sensing is our inferior
function which means we don't have as
good of a grasp on it naturally
as our dominant n e r f i even our te
which is kind of like this proud kid
that likes to show off
introverted sensing is difficult for us
but it gets less difficult
when we accept that we're never going to
use it the way an sj who highly values
it is going to use it so i was raised in
an sj family
everyone except my sister who's an istp
was an sj in my family and they had very
logical sequences for planning
everything they were very
detail-oriented people
and i learned very quickly that trying
to
plan my future with s.i is a disaster
if i try to make a slow consistent plan
that brings me towards my goals
i will want to stab my eyeballs out like
five minutes in and i will absolutely
not finish that plan i might start
get super depressed beat myself up and
stop but that's like the best it's ever
going to be if i try to plan my future
in a solely si way but what your si
naturally loves to do as an enfp
is reflect on the past okay so we're
going to start capitalizing on that
don't try to plan your workday with si
do try to use si as a tool for
mindfulness because your brain
already naturally does that i talked a
little bit about this in my video about
feeling stuck as an enfp
but one of the best things you can
possibly do is start to create
neutral reviews of yourself and all that
means is checking in with yourself on a
regular basis
i do it at the end of every night and
going okay what worked really well today
and what didn't work so well and there
are a lot of different ways you could
structure this exercise
depending on what you're looking for
there's a period of my own life when i
was in university when i was
really unhappy and really unmotivated
but i couldn't really figure out why
so what i did was every single day i sat
down at the end of the day and i wrote
out hour by hour
what i was doing over the course of the
day and i had a color coding system
where i highlighted how i felt
at every hour of the day so like yellow
was really happy
pink was kind of medium red was like oh
i feel really bad really stressed out
really low energy um and then there's a
few other colors in between
and then after a month i took all of
those daily reviews i put them out on
the floor
and i looked for patterns in terms of
when i was feeling what i learned that
tuesdays and thursdays i had a giant
red block right after lunch i didn't
like my tuesday thursday afternoons
but i always had a yellow block monday
wednesday and friday afternoons and i
realized
it's because monday wednesday and friday
i would have lunch with my roommate and
i would have some human interaction in
the middle of the day
tuesdays and thursdays i'd be studying
solo all day
and my energy would start depleting fast
by mid-afternoon
you might notice patterns socially you
might notice patterns with exercise you
might notice patterns in how much you
sleep or what you're eating
or who you're spending your time with
but using introverted sensing to stay
mindful
of what you're feeling and thinking when
and then finding patterns within that
is going to help you figure out how you
could tweak and optimize your schedule
in order to give yourself more of what
you need and less of what you don't
all you have to do is check in with
yourself once a day put an alarm on your
phone to remind yourself to do it you
might even find that after a while it
feels really nice because you're really
taking yourself
and your emotional experiences seriously
and you're showing up for yourself in a
better and healthier way
by developing an awareness of how you do
that in the first place
okay the last tool for introverted
sensing is one that we again talked a
little bit about in my last enfp video
but i really suggest this for anyone who
is feeling
kind of an overwhelming sense of
depression or inability to work or
inability to focus or get excited about
anything or start anything
because often when we're in that place
as enfps it's because we have gotten so
used to inaction
that we are in a downward spiral okay so
our brain activity is not oriented
towards action it's not oriented
towards learning or explanation or
growth we're just kind of stuck in this
cycle
of thinking negative thoughts taking
negative actions not showing up for
ourselves and that
absolutely perpetuates more depression
and angst and stress
and i don't want you to feel ashamed or
embarrassed if you're here oh dear god
i've spent so much of my life here
um but i think we actually really
overestimate
how difficult it would be to start an
upward spiral it's often not as hard as
we think so if you're in a place where
you're really feeling like
motivation is almost impossible for you
producing anything is almost impossible
for you
what you need to do is just start by
building
micro accountability with yourself so
pick one
very small thing you want to do every
day it could be meditating one minute a
day
it could be walking for five minutes
every morning it could be
brushing your teeth first thing in the
morning and just
show up for yourself in one small way
every single day for a week
and start building that sense of micro
accountability
of knowing i will do what i said i'd do
just because i said i do it and so i can
trust myself
the more you begin to trust yourself to
show up for yourself
to complete the small goals that you set
up for yourself the more and more you're
going to start trusting yourself getting
that little hit of dopamine when you
complete your goal however small
and i really really do encourage you to
start small and once you get that hit of
dopamine again
that's that neurotransmitter that causes
you to seek more environmental rewards
right
so you do one thing you said you do and
your brain goes huh that felt pretty
good
i wonder what else i could do but you
have to take that first little step
that sets you moving in that direction
and using introverted sensing to set
those tiny goals
and to make tiny tiny tiny progress
towards them every day
is gonna be the function that ultimately
helps you get back in motion
all right my camera battery is on the
brink of collapse and i think that's all
i have to say for today but as always
let me know your thoughts in the
comments
let me know any productivity tools that
work for you because seriously the best
piece of advice i ever got personally
came from another enfp on the internet
whose real name i don't even know
and if you are looking for a program
that kind of whips you back into shape
get some natural energy flowing back
into your life i do run
six week enfp soul bootcamp programs
that are designed to help you get back
in touch with yourself and start showing
up in an authentic and engaged way in
the world and a lot of that has to do
with lifestyle design and productivity
so you can find that boot camp on my
website at www.heidiprev.com
the link is in the description to this
video and until next time
i love you guys thanks so much for
watching this video and i will see you
next time
