hey guys so first of all please excuse
the
quality and overall kind of messiness of
this video i'm filming on my laptop
um because i'm in the middle of a move
right now and all my camera equipment is
at my other place but i realize it's the
last day of 2020 and i had said multiple
times that i wanted to make a resource
list
of all the best books and resources that
i came across in 2020 because it's been
a year of
finding really really good ones um i
think that i
read somewhere around 100 books this
year and
a lot of them were very mediocre and
then some of them
were what i call like paradigm shifters
just books that came in and made me
think about a certain topic completely
differently and gave me like a very
strong aha moment so i wanted to share
some of those with you
and also to talk about which apps and
resources really helped me this year
because it wasn't all books
um books are an awesome tool for
learning but so is the internet so i
also found
at least one incredible online program
um as well as like a couple of apps that
were really helpful this year
so i will walk you through what that
looked like so
i was trying to figure out where to
start and i think i'm gonna have a lot
of honorable mentions on this
list but where my kind of personal
development
work started uh in 2020 was
i decided to sign up for a nutrition
course at the beginning of the year so
about two years ago i got contacted by
the school called
the institute for integrative nutrition
and they're a school that
trains people to become health coaches
and they take a very very
holistic approach to health so basically
they have experts in the field come
in and talk at their school like left
right and center and then if you
take their year-long health coach
training program you get
video lessons from like all of these
experts in the field and what's really
cool about them is that they're a very
um like n organization i would put money
on the founder being an infj
i have my qualms with him specifically
um he was a landmark forum leader
and we're gonna get to my worst resource
of
2020 very soon which is the landmark
forum um but the school itself was very
very helpful
also we can separate people from like
the things they did like
i don't think that him having been a
landmark forum leader um
means that the school was bad the school
was fantastic um
i just felt the need to provide that
caveat for reasons i'll get to later
but um the school was really great so i
went there did a speech in like 2018 on
personality types
and i just had a very positive
experience like the school was a bit
like woo-woo
um so i was like i don't know i don't
know what i think of this at the time
and then it kind of got stuck in my head
though like i just really liked all the
people i met there
and all the talks i listened to while i
was at their conference because i asked
if i could attend which is something i
always do when i
go speak somewhere um so i stuck around
for a couple days listened to all the
speakers and was like wow this is really
cool
um fast forward like two years later i
was like you know what i'm gonna do
their health coach training program just
cause i'm curious
so i signed up for that early 2020 and
that's actually not even a resource that
i'm recommending i do recommend it if
you want to become
a health coach if you're interested in
exposing yourself to a ton of dietary
theories because they introduce some
crazy amount of them like 400 different
dietary theories and you get to kind of
be introduced and they encourage you to
like try them all out like eat this way
for a week see how you feel
and a lot of great things came out of
that i learned that
i have had eczema my entire life like
very bad eczema like cracked bleeding
everywhere all over my body eczema
it's a allergy i learned like a
month
in that eczema is very commonly either a
dairy allergy or like a sugar
reaction so i quit sugar and dairy and
my eczema disappeared
for the first time ever in my existence
um so that was
astounding but anyways the only reason i
even brought up i n besides the fact
that it is a cool place where i learned
a lot
that resource brought me to my first
really
kind of game changer of a book which is
fat is a family affair by judy hollis
so i'm not going to go too into the
details but
i've never had like a great relationship
with food
in that it's just never been kind of
like a chill time between me and food
like it's always been like a very
intense on and off relationship um and
so i read the book fat as a family
affair by judy hollis and she is someone
who
was an addictions counselor when she was
working as an addictions counselor
she was um obese herself and she started
to realize like oh there's a lot of
parallels between the way that i
approach food and eating and the way
that addicts approach
um you know their drug of choice so she
started researching
what what addictive behaviors are
present in the way that we approach food
as a society
um and is it you know unique individuals
um and this was the first book that was
really
a game changer for me because it was
also a very very
intuitive approach to eating so you read
a lot of books about
um whether it's like disordered eating
or um
how people approach food that are just
kind of like
have these very blase blanket statements
like oh
disordered eating is about control
and it like i'll kind of read them and
be like eh i can see it but it doesn't
feel
like a giant revelation it doesn't feel
like the most true thing i've ever read
this book felt like the most true thing
i've ever read because she talked a lot
about how people who seek comfort
in either drugs alcohol food
are often people who don't know how to
be interdependent
and don't know how to um relate
healthily to other people
and for years i've kind of been very
aware of my attachment style which is
very
far on the avoidant side of the spectrum
i'm gonna say very far but like
considerably so um
and i've never felt like there's a
reason for me to change that because
it's always felt comfortable for me like
i just feel very comfortable alone
relationships make me feel smothered i
get into them
and there are problems within them when
i do
um but it's never the problems have
never been so much
and being alone has never been a problem
for me to the point where i'm like well
why would i change the part of myself
that just loves life alone
but reading this book made me realize
like my inability to
relate deeply to other people and be
aware of my own needs
and be aware of my
need for connection and interdependence
is ruining my health
like the way that she describes it in
the book is basically she has okay she
has this one line
or she says you're as fat or is like
underweight depending on your
relationship with food
as you are dishonest and dishonest isn't
necessarily a word that um i personally
would use
to describe myself like i think i'm
fairly honest but what i think i also am
is very unconscious of my
deeper needs for connection and um
and like interpersonal
dependence um so she talks a lot about
that in the book she talks a lot about
how a lot of people who have unhealthy
relationships with food
actually have unhealthy relationships
with people and what you need to attend
to is your
unhealthy relationships with people and
you need to learn to become a person
who's very aware of their own wants and
needs um who's able to express those
things clearly to other people and kind
of let other people in
and have this very deeply interdependent
relationship between
yourself and other people and that's
something that i know i have never had
in a healthy way um at least not to the
extent that i need it
so this book actually pivoted me
like i kind of feel like there will
always be a before i read this book and
then after i read this book
not necessarily because the the
information that she gave about
um food or eating or eating disorders
itself was so pivotal but because
this book framed it in a way that
actually convinced me this is something
i need to do some work on like it's now
worth pursuing fixing my attachment
style because the case she made
for the need for people to be
interdependent or else they're going to
ruin their health was so strong
um another really good one along those
lines was the body says no by gabor mate
i forgot that i read that this year
um that's an honorable mention it's not
like on my list of top ones
but it was also a really good story
about how if you're not aware of your
needs
and if you're not aware of what you like
really deeply want and you just kind of
go through life without um
um like expressing it fully you're gonna
die of cancer
so that was that was another good one
that i read um i really like just
holistic approaches to health and
wellness in general
so that book led me to my next
incredible resource of 2020. i read fat
as a family affair around may probably
and then i found the personal
development school by tyus gibson in
october
um but it was the first incredible
resource
that i found for attachment style work
to the point where i literally have
never found another resource that i've
ever recommended about attachment style
so i've been studying attachment style
ironically since like university
um i took a a class where for you know
like six months all we talked about was
attachment style
and i was like this is interesting but a
lot of the modern day pop psychology
stuff about attachment style is
so unbelievably wrong
and so biased and so negative towards
certain types
particularly mine like a lot of the
attachment style stuff that i read is
very very they speak very positively and
hopefully about the
anxious attachment and they're kind of
like yeah you can fix it
i think a lot of people who do
attachment style work um might be
anxiously attached or might have started
out as anxiously attached so they see
that kind of
world very clearly similar to how a lot
of intuitives are in the
myers-briggs space but not a lot of
sensors are so then the way that sensors
get written about isn't necessarily fair
or robust
um and in the attachment style space
that's the way that uh avoidantly
attached people are written about like
it's kind of like oh just these people
are monsters don't
interact with them don't date them
they'll never change they don't want to
the personal development school is the
first resource
i've found where they talk about
avoidantly attached people as
humans who have their own set of
problems that's
just as complex and important and worth
dealing with as anxiously attached
people
it manifests completely differently
but they're very very very fair to
avoidantly attach people
they also go really deep into the
fearful avoidant attachment style which
is one where when you read about it
anywhere else it's like oh yeah those
people are just like you have no
hope of ever getting better
um and tyus gibson self-identifies as
someone who has healed from the
fearful avoidant attachment style which
is also called the anxious avoidant
attachment style
um i have a lot more videos i want to
make on that
because i also think that's an
attachment style that everyone like
thinks they are but most people aren't
it's like the infj of attachment theory
but um anyways so she deals with
attachment styles that are on the
avoidance side of the spectrum whether
it's fearful avoidant or
dismissive avoidant very well very
thoroughly
very convincingly um and she provides so
much hope so the personal development
school basically they have a youtube
channel which is what sucked me in
originally um where tys gibson gives a
ton of great information like
an unbelievable wealth of information
but she also has a school
that you can get a subscription service
to for 67
and she's made like a ton of courses
like there must be like 50 courses on
there
um and she recommends an order that you
take them in and she believes that you
can heal your attachment style which is
something that is commonly
accepted in like the attachment style
world um like it's believed that you can
heal your attachment style
it's just not always laid out how i'm
like they're like just kind of work with
a therapist and i hate the
advice
work with a therapist because it doesn't
give enough information about
um like what expectations you should
like
therapy just doesn't work for everyone
is the short story of it um i'm someone
who doesn't
respond super well to therapy i have had
experiences with therapists that have
been positive for sure
but it's like if i were to rank all the
things that have helped me grow and
change
and get better from problems i've had in
my life therapy would be maybe like
somewhere between the 90 and 100
thing that that's helped me um but books
have helped me courses have helped me
um just learning things on my own has
helped me and the personal development
school has helped me in a way that i
truly didn't know i could be helped by a
resource um
like finding a place where my attachment
style is treated
so humanely and with so much empathy and
so much
understanding um and so much talk about
how to change it
and how to um just change the way that
you're like thinking and feeling and
experiencing the world on an extremely
extremely deep level
i never thought ever in my life i'd find
a resource like that for attachment work
um and it's been incredible it's really
really hard work
um so i've taken three of the courses
now
i'm aiming to take about 12 of them over
the next couple years
and i already see humongous changes just
in the way
that like i'm becoming aware of kind of
subtle
needs and emotions and um
yeah ways i could be relating to people
especially my intimate relationship
that i did not know was an option to
to feel or to experience or to to be a
part of
um like it's really deeply helped me
change the way that i think about things
which is not something that i do easily
like i have
i can be very set in my world views and
i'm open to growth but
i'm there's very little that i truly
deeply
invest in and truly deeply go okay this
is something i'm going to focus a lot of
work on
because there's only so much room in the
psyche for doing that like you have to
pick what you're gonna work on
wisely um and this was one where i'm
like i am
all in i'm just all in on working on my
attachment style because i feel like i
finally have the means to know how to do
that
um and that's been changing my life
so um i'll rewind a bit so in may i
found the pers
or in may i found fat as a family affair
in
june ish i found the empowerment dynamic
so
the empowerment dynamic is known as the
antidote to the drama triangle
so the drama triangle is a model i've
been familiar with for years it talks
about
how it's a conflict model basically so
it talks about
how in interactions that are not
positive or not productive
um people are usually taking one of
three stances and we all switch around
and we play different roles within the
conflict
um but all of them are kind of
destructive so all of these roles are
called victim persecutor and you know
i'll just make a whole different video
on it but um
i've loved the drama triangle for years
but there's
a book called the empowerment dynamic
that's the antidote to the drama
triangle so it's like
okay what to do if you don't want to be
in the drama triangle anymore and for
some reason i just hadn't read this book
probably again because for a long time i
wasn't interested in it like i didn't
think
that changing the way i argued or
interacted with people
was particularly important or worth
investing in
and then i ended up reading the
empowerment dynamic this year and was
like oh
me why did i not read this before
it is
so good it's one of those books that's
kind of like told as a fable or
um like a you know a like fantasy story
so you have to be able to stomach that
um and like i don't like when stories
are told that way i like when someone
just gives me the information
um but if you can get past that the
lessons in it are so good because it's
like okay every time you're in this role
in the drama triangle
here's the role you can switch to in the
empowerment dynamic and it's just
this beautiful system for making you
realize
how many choices you have even in really
bad situations and 2020
was a really bad situation for me in
many ways that
um i won't get into here or probably
ever maybe i'll talk about it like 10
years from now because there's still a
lot that i'm
working through in relation to this year
but um i found it when i was in a really
bad
place just like mentally emotionally um
and it really drastically changed the
way that i was thinking about things and
again
that's not something that a lot of books
do um and the brilliant thing is i read
it in one sit in the bathtub like i said
in the bathtub and read the entire
things it's super short
and it only gives you the information
you need to know and like a weird story
about a guy walking on the beach that
like narrates all the information
but i love when books do that i love
when you don't have to read like 12
chapters of complete they just
give you like oh here's the point of
this book i'll give it to you in like
five chapters
so you can read it in an hour it's super
short and it if you
if you integrate it here's the thing
about the drama triangle
i've never found a model that works a
hundred percent of the time
until i found the empowerment dynamic
the empowerment dynamic is tricky
because a lot of the time it really
requires you to let go of attachment
to something that you have in your life
let go of your attachment to outcome
or let go of um your pride
but if you can do that it will work 100
of the time i've
never had a situation where i have
earnestly and wholeheartedly chosen to
step into the empowerment dynamic in any
sort of interpersonal interaction or
conflict and had it not work
so i love this model because i truly on
my deathbed believe
it works 100 of the time so the power of
ted or
the empowerment dynamic um is an awesome
bug um
oh i did say i would circle back to my
worst resource of 2020. so right in the
middle of this list let me stick that in
there
landmark forum i went to the
landmark forum
the last week before quarantine started
my last free weekend i used at the
landmark forum and i will regret that
forever but um you know not actually
though because
basically landmark was this resource i'd
been hearing about for years
people either think it's a cult or they
absolutely love it and i
totally get why like sitting in the
landmark forum was kind of like having a
friend come to you
and be like my partner beats the
out of me
but i but they love me so much and you
don't understand
and it's like i'm sure both things are
true i'm sure they love you
um you're not always sure of that but
like i i'm very much of the belief
abusive partners can
love their partners they're just like
you know um
but you're like yeah they love you i get
it
when i talk to people who are hardcore
committed and converted to landmark and
they're like landmark understands me
they love me i'm like
okay but they're also beating the
out of you psychologically
um and there is an option
to be loved without having the
beaten out of you just
so you know um and that's how i feel
about landmark it's like i get that it
provides people with good resources
but it also um mentally emotionally
spiritually and financially beats the
absolute loving out of people and
it is the worst take on trauma
i've ever seen in my life the way that
they talk to people about trauma and
approach it
and if you i went down like a a wiki
hole
and basically if you go down a wiki hole
about landmark you will find some
dark ass in there um
so that was my worst resource of 2020.
run screaming in the other direction
from landmark if um anyone ever tries to
like convert you because it's all about
like oh enrolling people in the
possibility of giving landmark money
um yeah don't don't do a landmark form
don't do it
personally contact me i will get on the
phone with you
i will give you a plethora of other
resources that
give you the same information that you
would get from landmark because again
they do have good information that's how
they
pull people into their web um but
without
all of the spiritual psychological abuse
a lot of it was just kind of pulled from
like nlp stuff like i i noticed a lot of
the same models in landmark that are in
nlp which is not surprising because
um they both have backgrounds in
hypnosis and stuff like that if you go
far enough back
both systems are corrupt in certain ways
but landmark is
blatantly brazenly unabashedly
horrendously corrupt
so yeah that was my worst resource of
2020. i understand that it's changed
people's lives but
um at what cost is
always my question like you can you can
do it in a very different way
very very very different way that does
not end up causing more problems than it
creates anyways next resource
um so i'm hopping around in time a
little bit here
um but the next book that i found that i
would
recommend is quit like a woman by holly
whittaker
so early 2020 i quit
sugar and noticed wow this had a very
profound
impact on my mental health um i did it
for about six months very strictly and
then kind of on and off
um now i eat a diet of mostly
non-refined sugar but like once in a
while i'll have something
um usually if i'm craving it around like
my period
but um i started also thinking about my
relationship to alcohol
and what i really loved about the book
quit like a woman
um is that it's about specifically the
alcohol industry like big alcohol and
how it markets to women and how it
um how we're socialized to just think
alcohol is this very very normal part of
our lives and that was exactly what i
was struggling with at the time
so i just started drinking more in
quarantine than
like i should have been um and i wasn't
like
drunk all day or anything like that but
it was to the point where i was like
i'm just not feeling good in my body
because i'm having a couple glasses of
wine right before bed every night
um drinking is like kind of the only
thing i really enjoyed doing in
quarantine which didn't feel healthy
so yeah it got to the point where i was
like i just don't think i need to be
drinking right now like
drinking is normally something i enjoy
socially but i'm not doing it socially
as of this year i'm just kind of doing
it whenever i feel like i want to break
from the
mind-numbing boredom that is life in
quarantine
so i was like okay i'm gonna stop
drinking for a while and
right before i made that decision
actually um a friend of mine
coincidentally had posted
a video of herself um she identifies as
an alcoholic
and she was a year sober and she
recommended some books and she was like
even if you're not on this like journey
of giving up alcohol for life and
thinking you're an alcoholic these are
some books i really recommend reading
for reevaluating your relationship to
alcohol
so the first one she recommended and the
first one i picked up was quit like a
woman by holly whitaker
and i loved this book because it wasn't
my favorite book in terms of like i
didn't have these like brain orgasms it
wasn't blowing my mind or changing my
world
but it was giving language to something
that i had already kind of felt but
didn't know how to put into words
exactly yet which was that we create
this very intense dichotomy in the world
between
alcoholics and people with a normal
relationship with alcohol but she's like
this is a like
very very destructive drug and it's true
like alcohol
is physically worse for you than a lot
of the
very hard drugs that we think of as very
bad and shame people for using
um i wish i had the stats available in
my head but she has
this whole chapter that's just basically
like oh here's the effects of alcohol
versus the effects of heroin the effects
of alcohol versus the effects of cocaine
the effects of alcohol versus the
effects of meth
and it's like in almost every case
alcohol is more damaging for your body
more dangerous to quit
um it's like more accessible to people
obviously so people get hooked on it
more often
but it's just like alcohol is this
horrendous thing for your body like it's
so bad so bad for you um but we've built
this entire industry
around like convincing people they need
alcohol at every single event they go to
um to socialize to enjoy a night in by
themselves
and she just goes really into depth
about like kind of the way that the
world is right now
and draws a lot of comparisons between
big alcohol and big tobacco
and how in like 50 years it's you know
we might look at
alcohol and the way that we consumed it
today the way that we now look at
tobacco which is that like it's super
that it was
that popular and that it was advertised
all over the place
um so that book actually changed my
thoughts a lot on drinking
because i've always been of the kind of
thought that like
oh the only reason you would ever quit
drinking is if you're an alcoholic
and i don't identify as an alcoholic
though interestingly
when i read the def like the the legal
definition of an alcoholic
legal i don't know who defines it um
someone defined it and the definition is
if you're a woman and you drink more
than eight glasses of alcohol a week you
are
legally considered um an alcoholic i
think because it's like oh that's how
many drinks a week it takes for your
body to get physically addicted to
alcohol
um so by that definition i was an
alcoholic but i
was not an alcoholic in the way that we
think of alcoholism which is like oh
can't stop drinking like
alcohol's ruining your life like nowhere
even close
so i always thought okay i don't have to
evaluate my relationship with alcohol
and this book made me realize like
yeah i do
like this is a very bad drug that i'm
putting in my body
regularly and i'm not thinking i'm
completely unconscious about my
relationship to it
anytime you use like an illegal drug i
feel like there's this kind of whole
thought process behind it or like there
should be
where it's like oh i'm using a drug like
i will not use this drug all the time i
will have this experience
and i will make sure i'm like using it
responsibly and stuff
but we don't have that for alcohol or at
least i don't like i never think of
alcohol as a hard drug
but it is it's literally worse for us
than a hard drug and we use it all the
time so it's like okay that's up
um if i were using other hard drugs
every day
casually i'd be like um time to think
about my life
but alcohol never gave me that pause so
i'm like okay it's time to give myself
that pause so i decided to quit drinking
for 100 days
i kind of arbitrarily was like if i
start now this was
late september um if i start now
i will my one my 100 days of sobriety
will fall on january 1st which is
tomorrow
um which i kind of liked because it was
like okay december has my birthday it
has christmas it has new years it has
all of these major events that usually
i'm just like
drunk as through all of
them like for like two straight weeks in
december i'm always just drunk
i only kind of like the the idea of um
quitting drinking through all of those
events and just seeing like how i feel
as an experiment so i stopped drinking
on september 22nd
and i downloaded the app that i will
recommend as my next resource called i
am sober
and i decided to do it just because like
i like to track things like i always
feel like i do the best at
maintaining something if i'm like if i
have a tracking tool for it
so it's a tracking tool every day it
like prompts you and it gets you to
pledge that you're not gonna drink that
day um and you can and it gives you like
a running count of like oh i've been
sober for like
one day two hours 30 seconds 31 seconds
32 seconds and i'm like i love this it's
just like
crack for the part of me that likes like
to pay attention to like how things are
progressing
um but what i did not expect to love in
the group
or in the app was the group so
i'm someone who um in like the four
tenancy systems i'm a questioner like
external accountability does almost
nothing for me at all
um it just like it's fine i can do it i
can like if i make a commitment to
something and it's with other people
like i'll do it because i wouldn't have
made the commitment if i didn't want to
do it but
it does nothing extra for me like i've
never felt truly motivated by having
external accountability
um but this group weirdly
was like the first group i ever felt
like oh i'm actually motivated
to continue my commitment to not
drinking because of this group
um because i got so addicted to the
group dynamic ironically
um but it was just like a good group of
people um there's a lot of
you know posts that i don't relate to or
whatever but basically everyone comes in
most people are anonymous and have a
pseudo name i did um i do
but we all got together on day one and
everyone talked about
um like there's like kind of like a
forum board never just talking about
like why they're quitting drinking and
some people are like i've been an
alcoholic for 70 years and some people
are like oh
i just don't really want to it's bad for
my health um but there was a little
group of us who were all in it for 100
days and we were all
um had the same intention to like stay
sober until january 1st
and i got so into that tiny group of us
and i
started feeling so connected to these
people which was so strange
um because remember at the time i'm also
working on my attachment style which is
avoidant which
it's like i'm a very outgoing very
friendly um
very enthusiastic person but i don't
have a lot of like
intimate connections like even my two
closest friends in the world
um are both also avoidantly attached and
it's like most of our
exploration of life together is just
either very intellectual or very like
making a lot of jokes about things as
soon as it gets like real and emotional
we just like laugh about ourselves
um but this group was very much about
delving
into why people were drinking um
and that was really interesting to me
because at the time i was delving into
why i use food and alcohol as comfort
um and i always have i have my whole
life
not ever to the point where it's become
an outrageous problem
but still more often than never which is
the amount that in my opinion we should
be using
um junk food and alcohol discomfort and
this group was really into exploring
that so people were talking about their
triggers they were talking about like oh
this happened in my marriage today
this happened at work today um i have
this up family dynamic that makes
me want to drink
and i'd never felt like i was part of a
group where i could share parts of my
life probably because it was anonymous
um was why it was so comfortable but i
found that like oh
i started sharing things i started being
like yeah i fought with my partner about
this today
it made me angry and anger is my single
um biggest trigger for drinking because
as an enneagram eight i learned very
early in life that the um
the the way i go from like 0 to 100 when
i'm angry
is not productive like it it
it's a very big challenge in
relationships
to say the least so when i was older
when i would feel myself get angry very
quickly i would often like just be like
oh i want to have a beer and i would go
have a few beers or whatever
and um it would calm me down enough
that i wouldn't get very outwardly angry
and i could approach the problem in a
slightly more patient way
i don't have any patience but alcohol
actually like kind of helps me
feel like i have patience in the moments
when i don't um so i was very much using
it that way
um and that's one way where it's like a
very clear
linear connection like heidi angry heidi
drink contour it's like conscious like
it's like i know that's what i'm doing
right
so i started talking about that about
like other things that triggered me to
drink
and i was just very impressed with the
community and
um yeah it reminded me
of um someone quit like a woman one
thing i really liked about it
was the fact that they talk a lot about
how
aa is not necessarily the best approach
it's just kind of like the most widely
marketed approach
i have nothing i mean like if a it works
for people that's great um if you're
struggling with alcohol addiction and
aa's what helps you
quit that awesome cool keep doing it
but aa really never appealed to me
um i've heard horror stories from it
i've heard it's extremely dogmatic
um so yeah i was never
interested in aaa quit like a woman was
very critical of a
a as are many books i've read since and
i learned a lot about how it is
statistically actually not the best way
to quit drinking like more people who
quit on their own
are successful than people who go
through aaa is just kind of the heaviest
the most heavily publicized one um where
was
where was i going with this oh yeah so
what i liked about the im sober app was
that it doesn't brainwash you and make
you think like oh you're an out of
control alcoholic who can never have
another sip again and
it was a very chill app like it's very
like oh some people are just here
because they want to take a break from
alcohol some people do identify as
alcoholics and they're also going to aaa
well they're a part of this app and they
have sponsors and all the other things
um but other people are like yeah i just
want to take a break for 100 days or
other people are like yeah i don't
identify as an alcoholic but i've just
been drinking too much and i want to get
back
and it was very very inclusive and the
group dynamic was very inclusive of
everyone who is at any
um stage in their relationship to
alcohol like there's even times where
people would be like oh i drank last
night and people would be like
how do you feel today um so it was a
very
good resource for people who are just
kind of like oh i want to re-examine
my relationship with alcohol um but not
like go to a.a because because for
whatever reason
so yeah another book that i really liked
along the lines of being critical of a
a um i liked and didn't like it i'm
going to call this one an
honorable mention but it's um i think it
was just called stop drinking now by
alan carr and alan carr is famous for
he's an nlp practitioner um and he
works with quitting addictions so like
tobacco alcohol
um and what i really liked about his
book his book was like media like the
book itself was like okay this is medium
i really like it i'm an nlp person but
like so it fits very neatly in my brain
but if i wasn't an nlp person like i
don't know if it would have been the
book that
changed my life and it wasn't but he was
saying like oh my clients come to me and
they want to know
when am i no longer a problem drinker
um which is the term he uses a lot when
is my drinking no longer a problem and
he's like you know in some modalities
there's no answer to that question
because
it's only not a problem once you're dead
and you haven't drank for your entire
life since your sober birthday
um but he talked about it as you're a
non-drinker
the day you no longer want to cope with
your problems through drinking
so the the first time you realize that
you no longer want that old coping
mechanism and i
loved that answer that's such a
clear measurable response in my opinion
even though it sounds a little bit um
vague
but that's how i decided to measure my
own progress in relation to alcohol in
relation to quitting sugar
um it's no longer about how long have i
used my willpower to overcome
the the desire that will always be there
to do this thing it's when is the desire
gone
and one thing i feel very proud of is
like my i hit my 100 day mark tomorrow
or i will hit my 100 day mark actually
tonight
i hit it tonight i don't think i will be
alcohol free forever um
but i it's like what really surprises me
is that i don't want to go back to
drinking like
my partner asked me earlier like oh
you're hitting your 100 days tonight
should we have like a glass of champagne
at midnight and i was like
i don't want to like it's it's not even
a thing where i'm like oh i'm a new
person
it's just like i've learned different
coping mechanisms and i know that if i
have
some champagne tonight i'll just
probably like i'm not going anywhere so
it's not going to be a fun joyous
experience with friends
i'm just kind of going to wake up and be
like the sugar made me feel bad
um and i'm very surprised by that
because i'm not like
inventing that like i truly just don't
want to drink because it doesn't feel
worth it i'm like oh if i want to feel
like i'm celebrating i'll do something
else to celebrate like we're going to
like
dress up and like order in pizza and
just like have a reflective call with
like some of our friends who we saw
um earlier who or who we haven't seen
because of quarantine this year
and it's like i don't know it's just
interesting because i i
the most interesting part of this
experiment has just been the fact that i
really didn't expect to finish it
no longer very interested in drinking i
thought i'll give myself a break
um but yeah i learned to really change
my relationship
with with alcohol with sugar and those
are things i didn't
expect at all this year um so the allen
car book is really really good for
kind of creating a benchmark for
yourself that makes a lot more sense
than having like a very clear harsh um
external benchmark for like oh if you if
you don't drink for five years then you
drink once all of a sudden your life is
in chaos again because it's like
i won't go there but um
anyways last resource is this book
called
how we change and 10 reasons why we
don't by ross allen horn
this book was one that i found i think
in november of this year
and i was having a really bad weekend
and um
i had gone and checked into a hotel in
my town i was living in vancouver at the
time
um which is something i like to do when
i'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed like
alone time really really helps me
um just kind of feel like calm and
relaxed and
um like i'm nurturing the relationship i
have with myself which feels very
healthy for me and
so i decided i'm taking a weekend and
you know giving myself like a staycation
and i checked into a hotel in vancouver
and i walked to a bookstore
because in vancouver everything was like
still mostly open because it hadn't been
very hit by the virus at that point
i walk into a bookstore and the book how
we change in 10 reasons why we don't was
like sitting there on a shelf
and for some reason i just felt very
like oh i want to go pick up this book
and i don't i'm not big on like oh like
your intuition is guiding you to walk
over here but that
this one really felt like one of those
things i went over i picked up this book
and i just was like i have to buy it
didn't know why so i bought it and i
walked to my hotel room and i had this
whole weekend of
activities books for myself at that
point it's like i'm gonna go for like a
long solo bike ride at four i'm gonna
book out the pool
at six i'm gonna take myself out to
dinner at eight
and i sat down with this book and just
watched every single plan
and commitment i had made for the
weekend disappear
like hour by hour okay guess i'm not
going on the bike ride guess i'm not
going to the pool guess i'm not going to
dinner
because i couldn't put down the
book and that doesn't happen to me with
a lot of books
normally like i'll to read fiction maybe
because it's designed to be binge read
but especially with non-fiction it's
like i'll read a few chapters kind of
put it down think about it go about my
day
pick it back up read a few chapters this
book was the first non-fiction book in
maybe
five six years that i just read cover to
cover
and then just turn back to the front
page and read it again
i don't know if it was just because of
kind of where i'm at in my life and some
other things that were going on in my
life that made it the perfect book at
the perfect time kind of thing
but this book felt like
it was giving me the answer to questions
i had just had boiling in my
subconscious my entire life
so the book talked a lot about the first
kind of concept that it
i'll backtrack actually a little bit so
as you can see through my entire ramble
that has become way more about me in my
life than
uh the resources i'm recommending this
this year has been
about changing my habits and behaviors
for for the most part um among many many
other things but at the time
there were still a lot of behaviors and
habits that i'm still at this point
actively working on that i felt like i
wasn't
really making progress on and wasn't
really getting the ball rolling on
and they were problems i'd identified as
having
had present in my psyche like my whole
entire life like since
as long as i can remember being a
conscious human being there are these
certain ways of thinking about things
that i knew
um or i know now aren't healthy and i
needed to change but i couldn't really
get the ball rolling
and i read this book and i was just
blown away because it talks about
not how to change it does talk about how
to change but it mostly talks about why
we don't
change and why we can have these
problems that are very present that we
know we need to fix and we know we need
to get
to and we don't do it and the first
thing the book actually
asks you to do is make the case for not
changing so look at your life and as if
you're like a lawyer on
defense trial of i never want my life to
change
convince yourself that that's what you
want because it's true
like if you're not changing right now
it's because
like we always kind of overvalue the
things that we want and undervalue the
things that we have
and basically what the book is saying is
like unconsciously we're very aware of
what we have
and how terrifying it would be to lose
it but consciously we're not
so we keep choosing the same thing
because the same thing actually includes
maybe 90
of what we want and if we have to trade
in 90 of what we want for 10 percent of
what we want we're not going to do it
our unconscious minds are going to be
like no
i'm sabotaging any any time we get close
to that because if i have to trade in
what i have that's working
for what i um want
that only gives me 10 as much of what i
have that's not going to work at all
and we don't often think of things like
that because again the things that we
have we take for granted but the book
basically encourages you to kind of take
an inventory of your life
and realize like these are all the
things i'd have to give up to change
these are all the forces that are kind
of like working in and against
my favor and it talks a lot about
holistic change so not just like making
a single decision to change something in
your life
but orchestrating all of the conditions
of your life so that change just becomes
this very
easy and natural thing it doesn't have
to feel like you're slinging yourself
off a cliff it can just feel like you're
taking the next logical step in a
sequence
um and that a really fit well with
everything else all the other work i was
doing at the time so i really saw it
happening in real life like even the
idea of
once you find better coping mechanisms
once you find ways to comfort yourself
that are not unhealthy
you'll just do it like it will make more
sense than doing the unhealthy thing and
it will be easy
and i really am into the idea this year
that like these big huge
changes can just be easy and natural and
not in conflict with other parts of our
psyche because i think that
at least my whole life where i've always
struggled with any sort of change
is that part of me wants it and part of
me doesn't right and it's
and it or it's infringing on something
and what i'm really learning this year
is that any change
i put into my life has to be holistic it
has to be accepted by every other part
of my psyche and it has to not be at
odds
or else it won't last it will last only
as long as i see this
like short-term results and then i'll
just go right back to the the
comfortable baseline where my psyche
isn't in conflict with each other
um so this book really kind of
solidified that for me and it also has
the most beautiful and
interesting um approach to hope like
they talk about
hope as this concept um i can't even do
it justice the way that they talk about
our psychological
need for hope and how a lot of the
changes we don't make
are actually us um being afraid of
hoping for something if we think that
the odds are not in our favor of getting
it
it's just like a a psyche shattering
book
i don't know if i'm just too in it um
and if it was too applicable to me
so i liked it extra but it was one of
the best books i've ever in my life like
top five
and that is a long like i read a
ton
like top five is a coveted
coveted spot in my list of books
and it made it in like it was that
good if i could tell
anyone like read one book it's how we
change not not one book but if you could
read one book out of this list that i'm
giving you now would be how we change
into reasons why we don't it's
phenomenal um so i was really happy i
picked that up
and the last book that i'll recommend is
the one that
my computer is actually currently
resting on as i record this
um but it is the five minute journal i'm
gonna actually i'll lift up my computer
and show it to you
the five minute journal so this is a
really cute journal
i am not a journal person um i used to
be when i was younger i kept general a
lot but as i grew older i never
kept them um but this is actually a
journal that my friend gifted me in 2017
and i i was having a year into that
like a bad bad
year in 2017. um yeah
and my friend gave to me this journal
and i remember i used it for like a
month or two when things were
like very bad and i was like oh this is
really helpful like it's just a really
helpful tool
for um prompting me to think about
things in a better way
because basically every day um i'll find
you a blank page
it's like you have these little
activities you do in the morning i do it
first thing when i wake up every morning
um and it asks you to list three things
you're grateful for and i've never been
like a gratitude person
you know like i've always been like uh
like it's kind of a dumb concept
but i gotta say this journal changed me
it's like
because it makes you realize when you're
so full of cynicism which i just as a
human being am
and when you're so angry at the world
which i have been
um i don't know if i'm gonna say this
year but
at many points in my life listing what
you're grateful for
just grounds you like it just brings you
down to the ground
and makes you realize like okay there's
an opportunity here
to really appreciate something and
really be
glad about the life i'm living and
sometimes you need that when you're
going through it
you know um so listening to things i'm
grateful for every morning has actually
been very helpful so
to follow up on my previous story my
friend gave me this journal in 2017 did
it for a few months forgot it somewhere
and then this year i went and re-bought
the journal for myself and it was like
the best
25 or whatever that i spent like um
because the second question i asked you
every day right after three things
you're grateful for
is what would make today great and it
has to be things that are within your
control so it can't be like oh
it would be great if like my partner
would stop being annoying
it has to be like oh it would be great
if i exercise today
it would be great if i sat down and did
two hours of work today
um it would be great if i ate healthy
all day
and what i love about this is that i got
in the practice of setting these
intentions every morning and being like
here are three options and i don't beat
myself up if i don't do them
but if i'm having if it's like four
o'clock and i'm like wow this day's kind
of
i think about what did i set my
intentions for this morning and did i do
it and if i didn't do it
um that's that's probably something
that's going to help me turn the day
around so a lot of the time i'll do that
um it's actually like a practice i've
gotten very in the habit of
is just recognizing where am i in the
list of things i said i'm
i would do that would make things
helpful and if i'm not feeling good
it's time to go do one of them and
that's been a really good practice that
i've found
has been incredibly incredibly helpful
for me just like navigating a year of
not my best mental health
and the third thing you do is a daily
affirmation and again
i've never been an affirmation person i
really i kind of hate affirmations the
way that we talk about them in like pop
culture
um but i learned this year to reframe
affirmations for myself um
and instead of going like okay i'm i'm a
famous superstar
and like telling my unconscious things
that just aren't true um
i decided to capitalize on just like
having growth mindset affirmations so
um some of my like i'll just randomly
open to some of them um
like daily affirmation i am growing new
skills
to be more emotionally self-aware was
one that i wrote a few months back
um daily affirmation i'm learning to not
judge myself for my
feelings and to let myself be aware of
what's coming up for me in the moment
so things like that where it's it's more
about things that i can practice
like daily practices i can hold for
myself than
telling myself i'm somewhere that i'm
not that my mind's just gonna reject
um so yeah that's cool and then
um at the end of the day you go to the
little
little nighttime section down here where
it's all dark and it says three amazing
things that happen today so you just
write down like three things that were
pretty cool that day
um and then how could i have made today
better and that is a question i really
loved that i feel like has been changing
a lot for me this year
because um it it provides you the
opportunity
to think critically about your day and
just be very mindful of
when did i feel good today and when did
i not feel good today so this has
actually been very helpful for me
especially in relation to my journey of
figuring out like how much
sugar i want to include in my diet um
because there would be days where i'd be
like okay i'm gonna have like a sugary
thing and then i regret it and i would
put it in the journal and then the next
day if i was like oh i want that i'd be
like oh no at the end of the day it's
going to be something i regret
and just having that foresight um to
realize
late like at the end of the day this
will be the thing that i regret if i do
it
really often does stop me from doing it
because i don't want to like set my
future self up for
for regret and um
you know just destructive feelings
like that um so it just infuses a lot of
mindfulness into your day
especially if you can do this journal
without beating yourself up and just be
like yeah
i did this today and it sucked so i'll
just keep that in mind the next time i
have the urge to go do that thing
um and it really is helpful it's one of
the only things where i've actually
found that
the way that i approach reflection
is very much changed by this journal um
so this is an
awesome book i really recommend you get
this book um
it's just such a good simple and
easy mindfulness tool and it's like i
wake up every day and i feel very much
like i'm looking forward to it which is
a cool feeling too
um like just kind of like my me time in
the morning i get my coffee i get my
journal
i set my intentions for the day it just
feels very healthy and very nice
so those are my favorite resources
of 2020. uh there's a lot that i read
that i really liked but that maybe was
just wasn't like the thing that was it
for me
at the time um but these were the
resources based on the work that i'm
doing at this point in time that i
really
recommend and who would i recommend
these two um
like it's like oh if you're struggling
with any sort of food issue
anything related to food that's
unhealthy whether it's like a full-on
eating disorder um
and that covers the whole range of
eating disorders um
like binge eating anorexia
bulimia orthorexia um
i really recommend fat as a family fair
it even if you're like oh i'm just a
person who like eats a little bit more
than i wish i did or
like i'm just someone who eats for
comfort and i wish i didn't
um that is a family fair just if you are
not
satisfied with your relationship with
food and you're an n especially because
it takes a very
um n approach to to this
i recommend fat as a family affair um if
you are
at all curious about your relationship
with alcohol and if you're thinking
about changing it in any capacity i
recommend quit like a woman
or because it is a very it's so it's
like it's
a fem it's a feminist perspective on the
alcohol industry but i think it's still
a really interesting book to read if
you're a male but there is also a book
called alcohol lied to me
i forget who it's by off the top of my
head but i also read that it was kind of
like the same ish thing as quit like a
woman but from a male's perspective
um so that's also a good one if you like
don't want to read the book quit like a
woman because
you think it's too girly for you but
it's not you should read it
also girly is a great thing um yeah
quite like woman is great for evaluating
your relationship with alcohol
the empowerment dynamic if you are alive
you should read it
if you've ever had a conversation with
another person you should read it
um the personal development school you
should check out if you want to work on
your attachment style and you should
if you should ignore 90 of the resources
out there about attachment style but you
should
really listen to the personal
development school um
i mean like anything take it with a
grain of salt but um but it's just such
a great resource
and how we change you should read if you
have ever in your life
wanted to change something and then
didn't do it and didn't know why and the
five minute journal
get it if you were alive um yeah so
those are my recommendations i am
rounding up on
59 minutes probably by the time that i
edit this like 55
so this is a very long video if you're
still here cool thanks for sticking
around and i hope that something i said
in my very long monologue was in any way
helpful for you
and um if you end up picking up any of
those books and reading them or
using any of those resources please let
me know i'd be very very happy to chat
with you
and just hear about how it's going for
you so
happy end of 2020 and good luck to all
of us in 2021
i'll see you guys there
