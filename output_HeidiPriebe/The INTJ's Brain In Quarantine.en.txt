good morning cognitive functions it is
day 228 of our official covid19
quarantine
year 28 of our proactive social
distancing measures let's go through
what's on the docket for today
and i would you like to kick us off yes
thank you te
as you all know this year has been a
gold mine for conspiracy theories
as per usual i started our day off by
checking in on which theories are most
prevalent this morning
i have a question uh more of a qualm if
you will
the whole thing where conspiracy
theories are destroying our ability to
function as a society
is anyone else starting to feel like
it's time to re-examine our moral stance
when it comes to our contribution to
that
i'm so glad you brought that up if i
i've actually begun preparing a
comprehensive analysis of all of the
conspiracy theories that are emerging
around covid19
so we can pinpoint which psychological
biases are becoming rampant in the
collective unconscious
as we all know those biases are likely
to pattern out into the future
and impact major world events in a very
significant way
now we do need to understand these
issues more comprehensively before we
can intervene
but several prominent themes have begun
emerging te is now a good time to
present my findings
no all right well the abbreviated
version is that the human race is doomed
and that doesn't depress you guys oh it
does
just not enough to log off we have to do
something with the part of our brain
that drives other people to enjoy sports
hey are we finally talking about me i
can turn on espn right now i heard
there's a game on today i see please
don't speak out of turn
you know if we do what she says it might
make other people think we're cool
yeah i've crunched the numbers and the
amount of time it would take us to
develop a cool persona
is completely unrealistic for us we're
going to stick with vaguely
intellectually intimidating until we
have a reason to revise
now speaking of socializing let's move
on to our second agenda item which is
zoom meetings
our first one kicks off at 10 am this
morning so i'll make sure we're
stationed by the computer and ready to
go
at 9 59 am sharp we can log on at 1009
the meeting is with our colleague sherry
and she's not going to be there on time
how do you know that well sherry's log
on times for morning meetings this week
have been
uncharacteristically inconsistent during
our last zoom call i noticed she had an
open jar of pickles next to her computer
which is a food that on a previous
occasion she'd claim to despise
she was also not wearing a wedding ring
which indicates one of two things
either her extremities are swollen or
her marriage is going downhill
however her husband is in my social
media networks and his posts indicate
that they're on good terms but not
so good that it seems as though they're
overcompensating for some sort of
marital discord that's happening behind
the scenes
there's only one logical conclusion
which is that she's pregnant and
experiencing morning sickness around 10
a.m each morning which is also when our
morning meetings begin
i suspect that this morning she'll log
on anywhere between
1009 and 10 14 am
she also emailed us last night and said
i have an ob gyn appointment and i will
be 15 minutes late for the meeting
no that's not how i knew all right well
following our meeting with sherry we
have a fairly standard workday so does
anyone have any questions or comments
before we wrap up here
uh yeah i do i see go ahead what are you
doing later t
i just delivered the agenda for the day
no i mean
what are you doing later essie are you
hitting on me
depends do you want me to be we are part
of the same brain
i literally am you yup well i'll take
what i can get at this point it has been
a long time since we've spoken to
another human being
as he has a point i'm experiencing
symptoms of loneliness
listen we're all experiencing some
psychological difficulty dealing with an
extended period of isolation
that's to be expected but i suspect our
interpersonal future is brighter than
ever
after all this past year has probably
caused a lot of people to develop a
deeper sense of self-awareness
it'll be refreshing to re-emerge into a
world where people have had the time to
check their psychological blind spots
educate themselves on world issues
develop a deeper appreciation for the
social systems that keep us safe and
protected in times like these
yeah i just checked the internet nobody
did that there is a new conspiracy out
there about the gates foundation though
thank god we don't have anywhere to be
until 10 10.
