So, it's quite common when people don't
like the way that they look physically
to just avoid mirrors for a period of
time in order to hide their own
judgments from themselves. And this is
psychologically what you are doing if
you have a shame bound identity. By not
showing yourself to anybody else in an
authentic way, you are avoiding having
your true self mirrored back to you by
anybody.
