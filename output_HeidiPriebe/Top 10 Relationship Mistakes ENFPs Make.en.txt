hi my name is heidi preeb and i am an
enfp
welcome to my channel you may know me
from the enfp survival guide you may
know me from the enfp soul bootcamp
programs you might just be here because
we dated briefly and it didn't work out
you want to hear me repent
or you might not know me at all in which
case i am very pleased to make your
acquaintance on this fine day
i have a feeling that you are here
either because you're an enfp or because
you have in some way
been burned by an enfp and you want to
figure out what was going on and what
was behind that
everyone is welcome if you agree with me
or disagree with me i want to hear your
point of view but we're going to talk
today
about 10 things that enfps don't always
get right
in relationships now not all of these
are going to apply to every enfp of
course
so things like age maturity attachment
style personal development work that you
may have done over the years
are all going to play into these things
so this is not to say that every enfp
does all of these things
it's just to say that having the
cognitive functions that we have
which are extroverted intuition
introverted feeling extroverted thinking
and introverted sensing
can predispose us to certain biases in
terms of relationships
that can make certain areas more
difficult for us than for the average
person
especially if we're not conscious and
aware of those but without further ado
let's talk about what we tend to get
wrong mistake number one that enfps tend
to make in relationships having an
entire relationship inside of your head
instead of in real life and here's what
that means
enfps and infps and ifps and esfps any
type that uses introverted feeling
and by the way if you don't know what
i'm talking about when i say cognitive
functions you can check out my other
videos where i play out what all of
these characters inside the enfp's brain
looks like
or you can also check out my bootcamp
course which runs through what each of
these cognitive functions does in your
brain and kind of play acts all these
scenes with them so you kind of get an
idea
of exactly how they play out internally
for you it's sort of like the inside out
characters
inside your own mind but anyways having
introverted feeling
is this function that is very prone to
fantasy
so something that i see a lot of enfps
getting stuck in is they'll create this
entire fantasy of someone inside of
their head
and have all these ideas about who that
person is and what they're like
what they like and dislike and how
they're going to impact your life
and then we forget to actually check in
with those people in real time
and see if those things work for them
hey does this relationship that i'm
having with you inside of my head
resemble who you actually are as a
person of course you can do it more
subtly than that
um you can just kind of check in on like
oh i have an idea that they really like
this hey do you like this and then get
some feedback on it
because we don't have extroverted
feeling in our dominant stacking
we can be really bad at checking in with
people in real time and getting an idea
of who they actually are
so we create these fantasy versions of
people inside our heads
and then we get really really let down
or disillusioned when they don't either
live
up to that or when they have different
likes or dislikes than we want them to
have
or when they're not exactly as in love
with us as we wish they were
and that can be an experience that can
break a relationship
because if we're only having a
relationship with a fantasy of a person
there's nothing real to work with there
so this is something that i see a lot of
younger enfps getting caught up in so
late teen years 20s this is a really
really prevalent thing for enfps a lot
of us start to move away from it as we
grow up and integrate those inferior
functions and learn that
okay we have to deal with the reality of
who someone is and there's often a lot
of grief involved in doing that which is
something that i want to talk about in
another video in and of itself
but the more accurate we can force
ourselves to be about the people that
we're dating the better chance you have
at building a really beautiful and
sustainable relationship with them
because you're dealing with the reality
of who they are
not the idea of who they are number two
mistake i see enfps making in
relationships
is expecting the honeymoon period to go
on forever and again this is generally
something i see with younger enfps but
it's a very very real problem so for a
while everything will feel super
exciting
super brand new like we want this
feeling to go on forever and then
reality kicks in and we get
bored or we get frustrated or we get
disillusioned
and a very common thing that i see a lot
of enfps doing at this point is bailing
and going oh well if i'm feeling
bored if i'm feeling disillusioned if
i'm feeling like
i'm annoyed or repulsed or rejected by
my partner that's a cue to bounce
no that's not a cue to leave the
relationship necessarily if it becomes a
pervasive problem
then absolutely but those feelings of
boredom of fatigue of getting a little
bit sick of someone are
totally normal and they're just a sign
that the honeymoon period is wearing off
and it's time to start dealing and
integrating the realities of who someone
is
that's when real deep love starts to
grow and that's something that you don't
get in the honeymoon period when
everything
is beautiful and intense and fresh you
don't get the real parts of someone
but it's learning to work with those
things and learning to look at the parts
of your partner that maybe aren't the
easiest for you to face and go i'm going
to develop some skills
for integrating this for understanding
this for working with this
that's when you really start to build a
partnership with someone that has
lasting power
so if you can stick it out past the
honeymoon phase and
into this phase where you're really
deepening your relationship there's an
entire new world of possibilities within
that that a lot of enfps miss
because they get out as soon as things
stop being easy and fun and exciting and
exhilarating mistake number three that i
see enfps making in relationships
leading with feeling and ignoring the
realities so once again this is a
product of underdeveloped te or si or
inferior functions so we'll let if i
kind of lead the show and go okay the
only thing that matters is how i feel
about someone
and often the way we feel about people
is very impractical because we're
attracted to unorthodox things
we'll fall for someone who's so
different than us or who has a
completely different lifestyle than us
and we'll find that very intoxicating
and very exciting and we want to explore
it
but then once that excitement wears off
we're left with realizing like oh
what i want for the future doesn't
necessarily line up with what this
person wants for the future and that can
be a really really painful thing to deal
with when you're like two years into a
relationship
because two dates in you didn't look
down the line and go okay where is this
leading you only looked at the positive
possibilities
and that's a great thing that you see so
many positive possibilities
but you also have to try to channel a
little bit of that introverted intuition
that you don't naturally use
i mean that's something that we do talk
a lot about in the boot camps is how to
access those shadow functions so nife ti
and esee
and how to use them in your life in a
way that actually helps you get closer
to the goals that your annie and fi want
because none of us want to be dealing
with these horrible breakups that just
rip our hearts out of our chest because
the emotion is there but the practical
parts are not
and we just can't make it work in
university i remember taking this course
on healthy relationships and they threw
this stat at us
that most married couples something like
80 or whatever
the reason for their divorce was
something they knew about and were
worried about within the first 10 days
of the relationship which is
crazy so these gut feelings that we have
that oh this is going to be a problem
down the line or i don't know if we can
make this work
we have to start listening to those
earlier on because they're
most often telling us very real
information that's going to become very
important later on
when we're already a lot more
emotionally invested and attached and
intertwined with that person
and that's going to make it really
really hard to leave which brings me to
relationship mistake number four that
enfps make which is that we stay in bad
relationships too long
because we hold on to these past
memories of how good things were
and we get obsessively convinced that we
can recreate that past so when you have
introverted feeling and introverted
sensing in your function stack
your perception of time doesn't work
quite the way that it should
so what that means is that you're
thinking more about the way things were
and your emotional feelings and
attachments that you have to the way
that things were then you are about how
things actually are
i see as dead last in our cognitive
stacking it's our eighth function so we
almost never access it
so we don't do that thing that other
people do where we look at the
relationship
as it is just the cold hard truth of how
it is and assess it through that lens
for people with sc letting go of a bad
relationship feels like letting go of a
bad relationship
but for people with fi and si letting go
of a bad relationship
feels like letting go of a good
relationship because we live in the past
we only look at how it's been and how it
could be and this can get us stuck in
this loop
of continuously thinking that we can
make something work when we really need
to just let it go because it's already
gone
mistake number five that i see enfp is
making in relationships you expect a
relationship to fix your entire life so
as enfps we also have an introverted
thinking blind spot and what introverted
thinking is really good at doing is
putting things in their proper
categories and understanding how things
work as a system
when you don't use introverted thinking
almost ever as enfps do not
you're not great at putting things in
the right categories so you conflate
things a lot and you might go okay
i'm gonna do this one thing and then
it's gonna make everything in my life
better not recognizing that that thing
might make
like three things in your life better
but you're still gonna have a lot of the
same problems that you had before you
embarked on that goal
so getting into a happy relationship is
often this goal that we have or this
thing that comes along and we jump on it
and we think it's going to fix
everything
and that's just so unrealistic
relationships
fill a very specific category of your
life so maybe having a romantic
relationship
means that you have more company and
that's great maybe it means that your
sex life gets more consistent and better
and that's a great thing
maybe it means that now you have someone
to plan for the future with and that's a
really nice secure feeling
but your relationship with someone else
is never ever ever
ever ever ever gonna fix a bad
relationship with yourself
and that's something that i see a lot of
enfps doing is we wanna outsource the
self work that we have to do
and go okay well a new job or a new
partner or losing weight or whatever it
is
we'll fix everything negative that i
feel about myself and that's never gonna
happen
so if you're expecting a partner to come
along and fundamentally change the way
you think about you
you're just setting yourself up for a
disaster but if you can be mindful of
what you're hoping a relationship will
fix and just notice like that's a
thought i'm happy that's going to point
you
very specifically in the direction of
the work that you really need to do on
yourself
so start using those fantasies as kind
of a guide post for what work you need
to do relationship mistake number six
that i see enfps doing
thinking that being self-aware means
being interpersonally aware so enfps
tend to have a very very deep
understanding of what makes
them tick because we have introverted
feeling that's a very introspective and
very self-aware function so we can often
tell you a lot about ourselves and we
think that that understanding applies to
other people as well
so we can fall into this trap of
thinking that we always intuitively
understand what other people need what
other people want from us
what kind of a relationship someone else
wants and once again this is kind of
related to point number one
we forget to check in and actually see
what's going on for people in real time
so we can miss really important
information about something that's
important to our partner because maybe
they have a different love language than
we have
maybe they have a different attachment
style than we have maybe they have a
different personality type than we have
probably they do and we really need to
humble ourselves enough
to understand that we don't know
everything about other people there's a
lot to learn
and we have to be comfortable at dealing
with people at face value
so if you're not taking your partner at
face value because you think you know
them better than they know themselves
you're setting yourself up for a really
toxic manipulative
unhealthy dynamic that's not going to be
good for either of you in the long run
relationship mistake number seven that i
see enfps doing
taking their fantasies literally instead
of using them as guideposts so
if you're an enfp and you've ever been
in a relationship you know the feeling
of waking up one morning maybe
slightly after the honeymoon phase is
beginning to wear off and going oh my
god i'm fantasizing about someone else
or there's someone else on my mind or
i'm thinking about my ex or whatever
it is and going okay that must mean that
this is the wrong relationship
a lot of the time having those fantasies
are perfectly normal and what they're
trying to tell you
is what you need more of inside of your
own relationship
so instead of going okay i need to leave
my partner and go pursue this new person
who i'm thinking about
think about what you want from that new
person or what you want to feel in a
relationship with that new person that's
absent from your current relationship
and then try to find a way to bring that
thing into your current relationship
so maybe there's something that you feel
like is lacking in terms of your routine
with this person maybe your sex life
with this person maybe your
interpersonal or social environment
in relation to this person and instead
of just focusing on this fantasy and
thinking you have to go fulfill it to be
happy
recognize that you're allowed to want
other things in your relationship you're
allowed to ask for things you're allowed
to bring things into your relationship
and talk to the other person about what
they're comfortable with if it's not
something that you're naturally getting
out of that relationship
but often we can forget to do that and
think we need to go chasing something
else
when really we could have a lot of what
we want within the relationship if we
just learn to communicate better
to state what's in our introverted
feeling talk about what we want what we
feel like we're missing
and ask the other person if that's
something they can help us get a better
grasp of within the relationship because
very
often we'd be pleasantly surprised if we
were to do that work
mistake number eight that i see enfps
making in relationships wrapping the
relationship
up in your personal identity so
introverted feeling naturally
personalizes
everything so nothing that happens to us
just happens to us we have to make it
this whole story about who we are
and we can get so caught up in how we
want the story to go that we forget
that life is not a story life is a thing
that's concretely happening
in real time as we're experiencing it so
to have healthy relationships as an enfp
you have to be willing to separate your
identity from the relationship and go
this is not who i am this is not saying
anything about who i am
it's simply saying something about the
dynamic between myself and someone else
and how we can or can't fit our lives
together
and that is so hard to do for anyone
because relationships in general are
this thing
that since the time we're young we're
taught to kind of wrap up in our
self-worth and like oh if people want
you it means you're good and if people
don't want you it means you're bad or
something's wrong with you
and there's all of this like shame and
these disgusting feelings that go along
with any sort of
rejection or any sort of relationship
that isn't going well
but you have to be willing to look at
those and to separate them from your
relationship and go okay
what am i projecting on to my
relationship because i'm believing that
if my relationship goes this way it
means this thing about me
and where can i start prying those
things apart and figuring out
this is my shame this is my sense of
failure
this is what's actually happening in the
relationship that needs to be dealt with
interpersonally
so the more you can figure out what is
yours to deal with personally
and what is the relationships that you
need to work out with your partner
the better you're gonna get at having
healthy relationships because you're
finally building a healthy relationship
with yourself
instead of just projecting all of your
perceived flaws and shortcomings onto
your relationship
relationship mistake number nine and
this is a big one for enfps we don't set
proper boundaries this is something i
see across the board with friends with
relatives with romantic relationships
for enfps
we don't use extroverted feeling as
enfps so what does that mean it means
that we aren't naturally good at setting
boundaries and figuring out okay what's
mine what's yours what am i supposed to
respond to when you ask me to respond to
something versus when is it comfortable
for me to go i can't be that person for
you i need to kind of put down a
boundary here
and we need to figure certain things out
on our own or we need to cheer each
other on as we do personal work
enfps really want to be liked we really
want to be supportive we want to be good
friends and good partners and good
people
so often what we think that means is
just giving and giving and giving and
giving and giving
and not paying any attention to our own
energy and what's going on in that
process for
us this is also um going to differ
significantly based on your attachment
styles so people who are either anxious
or fearful avoidant are probably going
to find that that applies more to them
people who are secure might find that
doesn't necessarily apply to them and
then people who are avoidant might find
that they actually have too many
boundaries around themselves and that
they can stand to loosen their
boundaries a little bit but i do often
see this as a pattern with enfps
is thinking okay loving someone means
always being available to them
always being attentive to their needs
and always giving them everything they
want and here's something we can learn
from our extroverted feeling friends
effie is not about meeting every single
want that a person has
it's only about meeting their needs so
people who use extroverted feeling a lot
so enfjs infjs esfjs isfjs
tend to be really good at going okay
here's where i can meet someone's need
and here's where i can empower them to
meet their own needs this is something
we actually talk a lot about in the enfp
and infp school bootcamp courses because
enfps and infps
are so notoriously bad at figuring out
what to want versus what's in need
in terms of other people's expectations
for them so let's say these coffee beans
represent your inner
resources so we have things like
your time your energy
your inner peace and different life
lessons that you've acquired along the
way that keep you going
delicious now i'm your friend
and i'm having a hard day can i have a
few coffee beans
okay so why did we do that
it made me feel good but when we learn
to do that
it gets really really easy to set our
boundaries in a place that's comfortable
for us
that allows us to keep meeting our own
standards for what a good partner or a
good friend or good family member does
without completely depleting ourselves
in the process and giving away energy
and resources that we don't have
oh i see so i have to draw my own inner
resources
instead of constructing my entire sense
of self-worth around how nice other
people think i am
precisely really i know
it's a lot to take in relationship
mistake number 10 that i see nfps making
and you all know this is coming is that
we stop watering the goddamn grass on
our side of the fence
and here's the thing i am not here to
tell you that you need to give up
everything you want from your life in
order to tend endlessly to this
relationship that you find boring or
understimulating or whatever it is
but i am here to tell you that that's
not the only way to have a relationship
so a lot of us especially those of us
like myself who grew up in sj culture
where everything is very linear and very
consistent and very long term
there's this association that often
happens where we think if something is
long-term
it means it has to always be the same
and what we forget about is the fact
that relationships are supposed to be
these dynamic
ever-evolving ever-changing things that
are very
interesting and captivating to us as we
move through life
you are not the same person today as you
will be in 20 years and your partner is
not the same person today that they'll
be in 20 years so avoiding grasses
greener syndrome is not just about
looking around and going oh okay i think
i'd be happier with this person it's
also about realizing that you're
assuming a level of stagnancy that is
going to develop in your relationship
that you have some responsibility over
not letting develop
so think about what it is that keeps you
engaged with something long-term whether
it's good conversations good
quality time going on new adventures
with your partner trying out new things
sexually
expanding your social networks in a
meaningful way together think of what
keeps things fresh for you
and then actively pursue them within
your relationship let your extroverted
intuition come
in and help you out here you don't like
watering the grass go buy a sprinkler
there are a million different ways to
approach a single relationship
and the more you can get yourself
thinking about what those ways are
the less likely you are to grow
disappointed and bored and frustrated in
your relationship because you're taking
active measures to not let that happen i
always feel this kind of deep sense of
kinship when enfps talk about their
relationship challenges and i could go
so far into depth with all of these 10
problems that i just talked about but at
the end of the day the beautiful part is
that every single one of them has
solutions
and not solutions that you have to
destroy your mental health trying to
chase
real tangible exciting solutions that
you can use the cognitive functions you
already have
to start implementing you are not
supposed to be unhappy
and weighted down and depressed in your
relationships you're supposed to feel
like endless options are expanding
within the relationship
and if you can find a way to build
expansive options
into any relationship that you decide
you want to pursue
that's how it's going to last and i wish
you all very good luck
in getting there and remember that if
you want to work on any of these skills
or if you want to get to know your own
cognitive functions and your
relationship challenges and their
solutions a little bit better
i do run soul boot camp programs so
these are six week virtual courses
for enfp and infp personality types
where we go over
so many of the things that we just
talked about in this video in extreme
depth so we pick apart the emotional
intelligence system we talk about how it
applies to enfps and infps
and the fantasy lies that they live and
creating lives that are both realistic
and happy for us which is the biggest
challenge for enfps and infps in my
opinion so if you want to know more
about that my website is
www.heidiprev.com and i'll put the link
in the description
and if i don't see you there i will see
you again on this channel soon
