one of these takes will work one of them
will work
hey guys welcome back to my channel um
it has been a minute i've had a super
hectic spring
there's been a lot of really major
changes happening in my life i moved to
toronto
permanently finally so i have a new
apartment which i'm not
currently in now i'm in like a weird
medieval hotel which is a whole
other story um but i will show you guys
my apartment once it's set up and ready
and in the meantime i just wanted to get
back and make a video about something
that i've been meaning to make a video
about for a really long time so
when we talk about attachment theory we
talk a lot about things like
love languages and how to give and
express love to other people and i'm
guessing that most of you who are here
are already fairly familiar with the
love languages just because
most of you are giant typology nerds and
the love languages is a pretty common
system
if you're not go google the five love
languages um by gary chapman
there's a really short easy book that he
released that gives you an overview of
them or you can probably find like a
million youtube videos where people
explain it to you really quickly
i'm not gonna do too much talking about
what the five love languages
are solely because i think most of you
are already familiar with them
but what i'm going to talk about today
is how to apply the five love languages
to your relationship with
yourself so for a really long time in my
life i kind of hated the term
self-love because i didn't really get
what it meant
um it was kind of like when someone says
something and you're like oh sorry i
didn't catch that can you repeat it and
then they repeat it and you still don't
catch it and then they repeat it again
and by the third time you're like i
can't i still don't understand but i
can't ask you a third time to repeat
yourself so i'm just gonna like
nod and like giggle and hope that's an
appropriate response
that's how i felt about the entire
self-love movement like i did not
understand
at any point what the term self-love
actually
meant so i had kind of an aha moment
when i realized that
the way i think about self-love or the
way that i see it described in the media
is very words of affirmation heavy so of
the five love languages
for me words of affirmation is dead last
it's like
way down at the bottom of my stacking
when people give me words of affirmation
i can appreciate that they're being nice
to me but it doesn't really land on me
like it just kind of feels like it goes
in one ear out the other
um so when i hear things like oh give
yourself positive affirmations stand in
the mirror and give yourself kind words
be kind with your internal dialogue
to me that doesn't feel like self-love
it feels like that's something i could
do but when i try to test it out it just
kind of feels shallow
and i realized it's because that is the
love language that i value the least
so when i started thinking about
self-love through the lens of love
languages
my top one being quality time it
completely and totally changed the way
that i thought about that term
and it also completely and totally
changed the way that i
approached self-love very very much for
the better so today i'm gonna go over
the five love languages and how we can
apply the five love languages to our
relationship with
ourselves i'm gonna go not in any
particular order i wrote some notes down
on my phone like usual so i'm just gonna
go through what i wrote down in the
order that i wrote it down so the first
one we're gonna talk about is
words of affirmation so again this one
is not huge for me
but it's still one i try to use just
because it's you know give yourself all
the love you can give yourself
um and a big game changer for me when it
came to words of affirmation as applied
to the self
was learning to affirm myself using a
growth mindset rather than a fixed
mindset
so a really big problem that i have with
a lot of
words of affirmation advice that's out
there is that you're supposed to give
yourself affirmations um and maybe this
is just like the whole manifesting
movement which i'm not
super into um but you're supposed to
give yourself words of affirmation that
are like oh i'm
successful i'm loved i'm rich but a lot
of those things your brain just doesn't
believe like your brain
is going to reject information that it
thinks is categorically untrue and
there's definitely a gray area there
where it's like okay
there are certain things where you could
believe them so you're reaching a little
bit but it could work
but then there are other things where i
really think that if you put too much
space between what you believe to be
true and what you're telling yourself
your inner critic's going to start going
off and going oh how could you even
think that how could you
pretend that you're already successful
in that way or whatever it is or that
you're worthy of love or
if there's something your brain really
wants to reject it will reject it if you
continuously say it over and over and it
might even criticize you for like
setting an affirmation that it thinks is
stupid which is always how it was for me
when i would try to set those
affirmations
when it was all the rage so what i like
to do
with affirmations if and when i use them
is give myself affirmations that
acknowledge where i'm at but that set me
on a better trajectory so on one end of
the spectrum we have you know
i'm uber successful and i have the life
i want and on the other end of the
spectrum
there's that inner critic that's going
oh i'm a failure at everything and i
don't have anything i want
and right in the middle there's this
beautiful opportunity for you to tell
yourself
i am heading in the direction of what i
want or i
am getting myself ready to go for this
opportunity or i am building myself into
a person
who can love and receive love in a
really healthy way and if you can learn
to give yourself
affirmations that open up little
opportunities for you
rather than just trying to trick your
brain into thinking that you're
somewhere that you're not
you're gonna start seeing those
opportunities everywhere
let's say you have an affirmation around
having healthy relationships
every time you're in an argument or a
fight if you're repeatedly giving
yourself that affirmation
i am building skills for healthy
relating
you're going to see opportunities for
healthy relating you're going to remind
yourself i'm in the process
of building this skill and then you're
going to seek out opportunities to keep
building that skill as opposed to just
going into an argument let's say and
going oh well now i'm in an argument so
i must not be good at healthy
relationships so that is off the table
so giving yourself that opportunity
rather than
trying to convince yourself you're
already there is going to be really huge
for words of affirmation when it comes
to self-love okay so the next one is
quality time
quality time is by far my top love
language and
i can immediately start speaking to this
in terms of pet peeves because i know
when someone is not giving me the
quality time that feels good to me
what's wrong so what's wrong when
someone's not giving me quality time is
often that they're distracted
um it drives me crazy when i'm hanging
out with someone and they're like
checking their phone a lot or they're
kind of giving me responses where i can
tell they're not really listening or
paying attention
um and i really really love having very
full-on experiences with people where
we're really engaged in whatever we're
doing or whatever we're talking about
that makes me feel really close and
bonded to someone and my entire
relationship with myself changed when i
realized that
i don't often give myself that form of
quality time
so living in the year 2021 and all of
the years that have preceded it in the
recent past
we live in a world that's very
interconnected very distraction heavy
and it's
really really hard to give yourself
completely uninterrupted time
so i realized that when i'm like off the
clock i'm not working i'm not
doing anything or there's nothing that i
should be doing almost
always i have this dialogue running in
the back of my head that's like oh you
could be working you could be doing this
what's happening tomorrow what's
happening the next day um
my brain is very rarely if ever
solely focused on giving myself quality
time and enjoying it
so i imagine this kind of as what if i
had someone sitting next to me
i was trying to spend quality time with
and every three minutes they were like
oh
well should we do this should we go to
bed it's getting late should we do this
what about that work that you have to do
what about that thing tomorrow should we
oh there here's a
here's a problem coming up down the line
should we focus on that if i had someone
who i was hanging out with who was
giving me the kind of chatter that is
often going on inside of my own head
when i'm trying to relax or enjoy myself
i would be so frustrated with that
person because that would not be quality
time
it would be time but it would not be
time that felt meaningful or growing or
like we're nurturing our relationship
so i realized this year that if i want
to nurture my relationship with myself
i have to give myself really good really
intensive really full-on quality time
and what that means
is giving myself time to rest to
recharge to do activities that i enjoy
without the possibility of doing
anything else
i started being strict with myself about
not allowing myself
to have anything else on the table so
what that means is that
if i have a day of work and i plan to
finish at 3 pm i now tell myself
even if you feel good to go at 3 p.m and
you want to keep working on something
else that you have to do next week or
whatever
you literally have to stop you
absolutely have to it's like a job where
they make you clock out and i'm
self-employed so this is
can be tricky for me um i'm gonna think
of it as a job where i literally clock
out
and then i have to spend time with
myself guilt-free
where i'm not allowed to think about
anything that i should be doing or could
be doing
um i have to give myself that quality
time and when i tell you
that doing that has completely changed
my relationship with myself
i could not be more serious um allowing
myself
forcing myself to take time to rest
spend time with myself
not pester myself about what i could or
should be doing
has completely eliminated all of these
negative habits that i used to have
i used to drink all the time overeat
um and have crazy insomnia
because i wasn't giving myself quality
time or self-love so i was going to all
of these crutches that made me feel
better
instead of having an actual relationship
with myself that was nurturing
and i really recommend that if quality
time is your love language take
time every single day if you can every
single day even if it's only half an
hour
just clear out time where you will not
feel any guilt
or any sense of distraction and you will
just
force yourself if you have to force
yourself to focus
only on whatever it is that helps you
relax or unwind or get into a flow state
it's going to be so beneficial for your
mental health that
overall in your life you will see the
impacts everywhere
so yeah treating yourself like a friend
who you wouldn't pester every 10 minutes
to do something else if you're hanging
out
is kind of the only way you give
yourself quality time and you have to be
strict about it but it is so
so so worth it next one acts of service
this one's going to be a bit tricky for
me to go over because acts of service is
my second last
so i'm not as clear on it but with acts
of service i think that what's
really really important if this is your
love language is making sure that you
are just
showing up for yourself so what i see a
lot of the time is people who have acts
of service as their dominant love
language or
as one of the love languages in their
top stacking they can be very focused
outwardly on helping other people and
giving other people what they need
and they aren't always as strict about
giving themselves what they need
um again because love languages we often
think of interpersonally
there is this um i forget if it's like
an inspirational talk or whatever but
it's called um
eat the frog and i forget what the story
behind it is um
there's some like you know parable about
some guy who had to eat a frog so he did
it right away i don't know google it
you'll find it
they like forced me to um watch this
when i was
in training for a sales role which is
the worst job i've ever had in my life
but anyways the moral of the story was
if you have something really hard to do
in the day
do it first thing like wake up and
immediately do that thing do not let
yourself do anything else
get the worst thing off your plate right
away so that the rest of the day you're
not plagued by the stress and anxiety
and like gnawing thoughts in the back of
your mind about how you have to do that
and i really find that when i approach
my own acts of service in that way
it completely changes the way that i
show up for myself because when you show
yourself
first thing in the morning i'm gonna do
this thing that's gonna make my day
easier that is a huge act of self-love
that is you
saying i'm gonna remove this thing off
of the plate of my future self
and i'm going to give my future self the
gift of being able to go about their day
knowing that they don't have to deal
with that stress throughout it
and i think that if you can get in the
habit of doing the hardest thing you
have to do that day the most laborsome
or annoying thing you have to do
first thing in the morning you're going
to build an awesome sense of micro
accountability with yourself
so i don't know whether that's doing a
work task whether it's doing a workout
if you're someone who wants to work out
but really doesn't like it or if it's
calling a friend who you've been putting
off calling whatever it is that is going
to give you a sense of anxiety and
you'll know in your body
like you can check in with yourself
you'll feel it feel the thing that
makes you like clench up the most and
kind of inhibits your energy the most
get that out of your way give yourself
the gift
of being more energetically free after
you've done that task and more free
mentally to think about what you
actually want to think about in the day
by getting that frog off your plate
right away
so the opposite of self-love when it
comes to acts of service is
procrastination when you have
this unending list of things that you
don't want to do that you're putting off
you are absolutely telling yourself i
don't care about you enough
to get these things done so that you can
have the quality time or whatever it is
with yourself that you really want
so finding a process and then being
strict with yourself about it that
allows you to get those really annoying
things done
quickly and easily and efficiently
builds accountability with yourself and
it's giving your mind proof i love you
i'm taking care of you look at what i
did for you right at the beginning of
the day
so i just want to pause here and say
that all of these things are about
building self-accountability so just
like
in a relationship with someone else you
have to build this sense of rapport like
you go to someone and they're kind to
you or they show up for you or they do
you a favor
and over time you build this positive
relationship where you think of that
person and go i know i can trust them i
can rely on them i feel good around them
you need to build that same relationship
with yourself
by loving yourself in a language that
you recognize so all of these things
are really means of building
self-accountability when it comes to the
relationship that you have with yourself
okay gifts i have a lot to say about
gifts gifts is
um definitely either my second or third
love language i'm not sure if it's
higher or lower than touch for me
but i think that gifts is a really
misunderstood love language a lot of
people think it's really shallow
and here's the thing gifts can be
shallow but so can words of affirmation
so can touch so can quality time
any of these love languages can be done
shallowly and badly
and what a shallow and badly done gift
looks like
is spending money or other resources on
someone in a way that is
thoughtless and not intentional so a
really bad gift
is something that you didn't put much
thought into that you just kind of threw
money at the other person can tell like
this isn't really catered to me
it's just you felt like you had to give
a gift or something
a really good gift is a gift that
conveys the message
i see you i notice what your needs are
and i want to help you fill a need in a
very intentional way
i picked something out for you and
whether that's a practical need or an
emotional need right
because a really good gift can also just
fulfill the emotional need of like oh
let's say you give someone
a necklace or a piece of jewelry where
every time they look at it they remember
your relationship and feel really loved
that's
an emotional needs gift and that might
feel really really meaningful to someone
who has gifts as a love language
so my favorite thing about giving gifts
is noticing
over the course of a year like let's say
we're leading up to my family celebrates
christmas
um leading up to christmas i'll write
things down over the course of a year
where i'm like this person could really
use this or this person seems really
stressed out about this problem or this
person's really excited about this thing
and i'll keep a running list of things
that are going on in the lives of the
people i love
and then as we get closer to christmas
i'll start thinking about okay which
items could i give them that would
either show my support for what they're
excited about
alleviate a problem or just show them i
really see that this is going on for you
and then finding a gift that fulfills
that need and shows that person i
see you i see what you're going through
and i'm here to support you in any way
that i can
is what a good gift is all about like
that's the
end goal of the gifts love language is
to just show people
you're seen you're understood and you're
supported in some sort of practical way
so when it comes to giving gifts to
ourselves we have to apply that exact
same strategy
it can't just be i mindlessly spent on
myself
which don't get me wrong i love doing
i'm actually very bad for impulse buying
that's a
problem that i have um but that is not
a pure expression of the gifts love
language right just buying everything
you want and then going into debt
or ending up with all of this junk that
doesn't feel that meaningful to you
that's a bad expression of the gifts
self-love language so what you have to
do if you want to give yourself true
gifts
is really start paying attention and
noticing where are your own needs
what things are you really excited about
what are you working towards which areas
are you kind of struggling in that you
could use a little bit of practical help
in
and then you need to start budgeting and
being very specific
deliberate and intentional about
spending your money or your resources in
ways that
fill those needs for yourself and this
sounds easy but i really think
very few people are this intentional
about the way that they spend their
resources so if gifts is one of your
love languages and you're squirreling
away all of your money on ordering
ubereats or doing things that aren't
really
making your life that much better some
people ubereats does make their life
better
i'm one of them but a lot of us are
doing at least some form of mindless
spending
and if we were to focus that resource
money is just one of the resources that
we have
on figuring out what we actually need
that's going to make our lives
considerably better and then giving
ourselves that so maybe budgeting for
a course we want to take or some at-home
gym equipment or kitchen item that ups
our cooking game if that's something you
like doing for self-care
making sure that you can be intentional
about the gifts that you're giving
yourself
and then actually learning to receive
that gift is gonna make a huge
difference
because there's two parts to gift giving
right one is giving the gift and the
other is that the person we're giving it
to they have to receive it and let it in
and feel it and go oh
thank you i recognize that this is a
show of love from someone right and if
gifts is your love language that
probably comes naturally to you when
someone gives you a gift
you know how to receive it and
appreciate it but if you're not
receiving and deeply appreciating and
recognizing the gifts you give yourself
as an act of self-care and self-love
then you're not getting the most out of
your own love language
literally write yourself a thank you
letter for it if that helps treat the
gifts you give yourself with the same
amount of care respect
and attention as you would give to a
gift that someone else gave you and
you're gonna start
getting it through your mind that you're
being intentional about the ways that
you're making your own life better
and again over time that's gonna clue
your brain into
i'm giving myself love i'm giving myself
respect i'm giving myself care and
you're gonna start building
accountability with yourself
and that's a lot better than just
spending mindlessly on yourself and then
having these inner critic thoughts about
it
so last love language is touch i have
been doing a lot of work on my
attachment style lately
and some of the facebook communities
that i'm a part of that are related to
attachment style
talk a lot about the love languages and
how you can give yourself what you need
through the lens of the five love
languages
and everyone always gets stuck on touch
because they're like oh the other ones i
can kind of get
but how do you give yourself the touch
that you need beyond the obvious
and i was stuck on this for a while too
but here's what i think touch as a love
language is not just about
um hugging or like giving physical
affection to people it's about
knowing that someone else is respecting
the relationship they have with your
body
so when someone touches us in a loving
and safe way we feel great and when they
touch us
in an unsafe or harmful way we feel bad
but
not a lot of us think about that in
relation to how we treat our own bodies
so when we're treating our own bodies
with care and respect
and love and nurturance that is fueling
our touch
love language and when we treat our
bodies with neglect
with distaste um when we put things into
our body that make our body feel bad
that is taking away from our self-love
language of touch right because it's all
about the respect that we're showing to
our physical bodies
and there are also some very obvious
things around this right so my
partner's love language is touch and her
apartment is like a cloud
like everything you could sit on is
super fluffy and cushiony and there's
weighted blankets like
everything is perfectly catered to the
sensory needs of someone who has touch
as a love language and that's
a really great way to approach it as
well so looking at the clothes you wear
are they super comfortable
anything that touches your physical body
that you put on your skin is touch so
touch is probably my second i really
love to like
take long baths where i'll like get a
bath bomb that feels really nice on my
skin
i like really cushiony beds i like
bathrobes that are snuggly and warm
anything that you put on your body is
touch but also the way that you treat
your body is touch
so if you are living an active lifestyle
if you're putting food in your body that
nourishes you
if you're taking the time to stretch and
to really treat your muscles and your
body with respect
your body is going to register that as
an act of self-love because you're
showing yourself
i respect nurture and i'm keeping my
body safe from harm
and that is absolutely in my opinion one
of the greatest things you can do for
self-accountability
so many of us neglect the relationships
that we have with our bodies
we might tell ourselves through
affirmation i love my body but if we're
not proving it to ourselves
if we're not doing things and whatever
that is is completely up to you
that make our body feel loved cared for
and respected
doesn't matter how many affirmations you
say your body's not going to believe you
because your body knows what you're
doing to it
and i have been the worst for this in my
life if there is a person
who has abused their body in every way
possible it is me
um so there's no shame no judgment there
but
that's also how i know that the power
of taking that control back and treating
your body in a way that it believes
is loving and respectful and caring not
just through words but through
actions on a daily basis can be
revolutionary for your self-esteem
revolutionary for your sense of self
trust revolutionary for the relationship
that you have with yourself
and the same goes for any of these love
languages but i think that touch is one
we misunderstand because it's not just
about touch from others
it's about the relationship with the
self with the body and physical space
and how we treat our body in relation to
our physical environment
okay that is all of the love languages
um
all of these are just kind of thoughts
and things that i've been
noting and jotting down as i do
attachment work because this is
really important
really really important if you don't
know how to love yourself in a real way
that will show up
everywhere in your life it will show up
in the work you do it will show up in
the relationships you have it will show
up in
the way you treat your body and your
mind there is not
a substitute for self-love there just is
not one there are a million second best
options that will
slowly and consistently destroy your
life
but there is no substitution for showing
the up for yourself in whatever way
you recognize
as showing up for yourself so the first
step is learn what you
need to give yourself proof that you're
showing up for yourself because you can
tell
yourself i love you i love you i love
you all you want but if you're treating
yourself
in a way that is not showing that love
to yourself
you're not going to believe it your mind
is smart your unconscious mind is smart
it doesn't believe affirmations that it
knows
are not true but if you start doing the
work
showing up for yourself in a way that
your mind really recognizes it's gonna
clock that right it's again like a
relationship with another person you
notice
if someone says oh i'll be there at five
o'clock and then they're there at six
right you get pissed off you don't wanna
hang out with that person anymore same
thing happens for yourself
if you're not keeping the promises you
make to yourself that is constantly
being clocked inside of your mind
be as intentional if not much more
intentional about showing up for
yourself in these ways as you would if
it were a relationship with someone else
because if we don't love ourselves we a
don't get anywhere and b
we just become holy reigning terrors in
the lives of others
trying to get all our sense of
self-worth out of them so this is not
just a gift for you it's a gift for
everyone else around you
who is going to benefit from you being a
healthy and happy
and self-loving person um so i'm very
curious let me know in the comments what
your love languages are
and what you intend to do this week
starting today
to start giving yourself that time so
i'm going to clock off at three today
and i'm gonna spend some time with
friends and i'm not allowed i have
thought boundaries
around what i'm allowed to think of in
that time i'm not allowed to think of my
work i'm not allowed to think of the
things i have to do i'm just gonna be
present and i'm gonna do some
version of that every single day
probably for the rest of my life even if
it's only 10 minutes whatever time i
have
i'm going to be really intentional and
present about so tell me what
your plan for the week is in the
comments and i will see you guys again
soon also oh my god
almost forgot if you are an enfp or an
infp personality type i run
six weeks whole boot camp courses
specifically for you
where we talk a ton about how to love
and care for and show up authentically
for yourself
so if that feels like a gift that you
would love to give yourself or someone
else
see what i did there um you can go to my
website at www.heidipreeb.com
and you can find those courses there and
now
i will truly see you guys next time
