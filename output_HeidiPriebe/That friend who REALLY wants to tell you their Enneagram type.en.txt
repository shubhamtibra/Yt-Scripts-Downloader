listen i am
a terrible person and it's really
important to me that you
kind of get that about me here's a list
of all the ways in which i'm gonna make
your life just a complete
living hell it's gonna be so fun let's
go through it together does it bother me
that you now know all my deepest flaws
in every possible way to manipulate me
god no i love that for us i think the
way to grow as a person
is to take all of your unresolved trauma
and use it as an identity
make it so that if you were to ever heal
yourself you would just have no idea who
you were
work that trauma don't work on it that's
not cute there's also levels of health
you can see that i'm right here in the
middle where it feels really really good
for my ego but just terrible for
everyone around me
i also have a wing which tells you how
i'm gonna behave whenever my usual path
of terror isn't working for
whatever reason then we have the
subtypes they're really important to
know because the more you learn about
the enneagram the more you're going to
meet a whole bunch of other people who
are like you
and that's going to make you feel less
unique can you use the system for
self-development of course
that's what i'm doing we're all blind in
one instinct which
is adorable that's why i'm never on time
for things and i bully people who go to
bed early
so i could be wrong about what instinct
i'm blind in because i also really love
to be rude to people and pretend i just
don't know any better
wow it's so fun getting to know yourself
i know we've already known each other
for 20 years but if you want to get to
know more about me which you obviously
do you can visit my blog where i take
everyone's deepest inadequacies and turn
them into a series of shareable means
self-awareness is so important i'm
really glad we had this talk hey guys
thanks so much for watching i'm heidi
preeb and
i use personality systems like
myers-briggs and the enneagram for
self-awareness and personal development
wherever possible

optimized life looks like for those
