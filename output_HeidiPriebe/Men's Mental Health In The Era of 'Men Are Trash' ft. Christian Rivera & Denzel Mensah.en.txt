hey guys i'm heidi preeb welcome back to
my channel i am excited today because
i'm with two
i wanna i i just think you guys as my
friends despite the fact that christian
we've never actually met in real life
but um
two my friends who
have worked in the
personality typology space for many
years in many different forms which is
kind of how we all met online
um
so christian and denzel and i
have had a lot of
different interactions over the years on
a variety of different topics online
um
and
i wanted to gather them both here today
because
both of you guys have been putting out a
lot of really interesting content
lately but also over the past couple
years about men's mental health so
before we jump into today's topic i just
want to give you guys a little bit of
background on what these guys are doing
in the world so
denzel is doing a lot of relationship
coaching as well as personality typology
coaching so he has a youtube channel
that has a ton of awesome content on it
if you want to go check him out and see
a little bit about what he discusses and
the work that he does with his clients
um what i love is that you will put
profiling and coaching sessions on your
youtube channel sometimes
so you can actually like see him in
action which i find really interesting
um so i will put the link to that in the
description of this video
and christian is currently working on
writing a book so you can find the info
on that at his sub stack which is can
you fill it in
yeah it's uh let's go see
note.substack.com
awesome and christian has also done a
ton of awesome work he's
uh run a youtube channel and a podcast
that's related to mental health for many
years so he has a huge archive of
information and awesome content that i
really encourage you guys to go check
out
um but first and foremost i just
consider these guys two of
most intelligent and self-aware men that
i personally know truly
who i learn a ton from and i feel like
you guys are always putting out
really
thought-provoking
twitter thread so we've all been
connected on twitter for many years and
had a lot of interesting conversations
over those times
and i had an idea to
make this video because i feel like in
the last
six months or so i've been having a lot
of conversations with the men in my own
life about kind of
what it means to approach
mental health as a man in the current
climate that we're in where
i imagine there's actually a lot of kind
of conflicting
messages i think being sent to met about
how to show up in the world um
and how you
let's say manage a lot of the criticisms
that get thrown against men in general
some of which are absolutely in my
opinion
uh a necessary backlash like kind of
coming out of the metoo movement there's
there's been a kind of pendulum swing i
think between
men not really being held accountable i
guess for a lot of things to all of a
sudden there's this swing to the other
direction of of like men are trash and
and all of this
really negative talk about men in
general and denzel i know that's
something that on your channel you very
directly addressed in the past is the
impact of that kind of wording on the
way that men think about themselves
and what i'm kind of interested and i'm
going to
mostly stop talking and i want to
hear a lot more of your guys thoughts
today than mine um
but what i'm curious about is
a i think i want to start with
how does that whole movement kind of
impact the way that men approach
their own self-concept like what impact
has that had on you guys
and also
what does it mean to kind of both take
responsibility for
the ways in which
maybe
men have shown up harmfully
intentionally or unintentionally over
the years without losing sight of the
fact that there has to be
a sense of self-compassion and
understanding for
for which issues kind of have led to the
place that we're in socially right now
that's a very big question and
i imagine we'll go in a lot of different
directions with this
um but i want to start off by
asking about how
that movement in particular like
using the phrase let's say men are trash
as a jumping point what impact would you
say that's had on your individual
like self-concepts or
um self-esteem as a man and what kind of
issues have arisen out of that for you
if that's not too broad
well yeah i know for me yeah i think i
told uh
you guys recently um
that or actually heidi just already knew
i had to mute the word men from my
twitter account uh for over two years um
i just over the past few months unmuted
that word because it got to a point
where every single time i saw a tweet
with the word men in it it was just
trashing men like back and forth like oh
men are just always cheaters oh men
don't know where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is oh men
don't like just all of this stuff men
are trash in this way are like oh uh i
don't know yeah there's just always
something that's
talking about how dumb men are how
conniving men are um how sick men are
you know stuff like that
and i know that whole
uh thing around the idea of like when
men are like well not all men i know
that's like okay you're part of the
problem because as a man you're supposed
to be supporting and helping us not
saying like well not all men
and i really want to emphasize that i
empathize
with women um i really genuinely do like
my to give just a tiny bit of backstory
like my father um he's still alive and
he's still in my life but
he was taken away from me
when i was 14 15 and i loved him and so
after that you know i was forced
at the age of 14 and 15 to stay with my
mother and my younger sister and i was
when i became the man of the house like
i was taking care of them during that
time and we had to move back to the
bronx
being women living in the bronx is not
easy you know there's a lot of different
social cues um over there and like i had
to be a protector in that sense and so
it's like really harmful
to ever you know either be directly told
maybe that like oh you don't have a
regard for women um or
you know subconsciously told that in a
way like just by constantly being
associated with men who don't have a
regard for women when if anything i was
also always the guy
that back in high school middle school
whatever like i was friends mostly with
women i listened to them they loved me
and if anything when i was with other
men
and they were like dating the women that
i knew then i was the one to be like hey
man like don't talk about her like that
like that's messed up you know or
i would even go to the women and be like
uh i don't want to you know trash out
like on my boy but i don't think that
you should date him because
he's this type of way and it's not me
like i guess going behind the guy's back
but it's like this is just unfair so
all that to say that i really
do i understand
where a lot of women are coming from to
the best of my ability as a man
but i think that a lot of them
don't understand
how much a lot of what they're saying
can be harmful
um
and once again i know there's like a
response to that where it's like okay as
the victim why should we
um coddle
you even if it's not directly you as the
perpetrator in that way and it's like
okay so in a way it kind of puts you in
this bind where it's like well it's
unfair of me to be like hey
can you guys say
more specifically like
some men or you know something like that
it's like no that's that's unfair of me
to request so the best thing i could do
is uh just
mute the word um because it became hard
for me to
see something
that was derogatory toward men
and then
go through all the mental gymnastics
like they're not talking about me i'm
not that type of man it's like all right
cool and then move on three tweets later
and then see another one and it just
kept on happening so it's like all right
you know what
let me just mute it um
but ideally all of that to say that
everything that i'm gonna say in here i
just want this to be prefaced with
i really deeply support women i really
deeply respect women um and i really
deeply
want to continue to understand them and
love on them and this is not in any way
to attack them
anything that i might say in this video
is not to attack women i actually don't
like the idea of men versus women like
putting them against each other but if
anything it's
can we come a little bit more to
understanding so that we can find the
best way to move forward together um
it's like i'll share my experience you
continue to share your experience and
let's see like the best way that you
know we can move like through certain
things even if it means like me putting
a little bit more of whatever's hurting
me like aside for the sake of the cause
does that make sense
yeah
a i i loved hearing your perspective
there and i appreciate everything you
shared and b
um what i find really interesting and
like part of the reason why i'm excited
to have you on this call specifically
denzel is you talk a lot uh on youtube
on twitter just in general
about your friendships with other men
and i think that's something that we
don't hear a lot about like there isn't
a lot of conversation about how men can
kind of support each other and i think
that
and i'm very curious to hear your guys
thoughts on this but
i think that like a lack of
we're lacking examples of like what
really strong and fulfilling and like
emotionally supportive male friendships
look like
yes
and i see you as a really big advocate
and someone who shares a lot about that
um and i want to circle back to that i
think later in the conversation but i
think that's a really big potential
source of like support for men's mental
health that would have such a net
positive effect so i love that you're
already bringing up like the
conversations you have with your male
friends and also with your female
friends about your friendships with men
like i just think that that's a very
underrated piece of this puzzle that we
miss a lot when we talk about
men's mental health
and i and i would
i'm also curious and christian i also
want to hear if you have
thoughts on
the first question
um
but i'm i'm also curious what comes up
for you guys when you hear the term like
men's mental health what does that mean
to you so christian i want to pass it
over to you
yeah if you ever question is more
interesting or both
uh yeah let's see what happens uh well
first of all i feel more comfortable
when i break the fourth wall so i'm
gonna start with that and say that i
love being here i love being with you
both i love denzel so very much i think
he's fantastic i love that
that basically heidi everything that
you're saying about what he's doing and
talking about the culture and
relationships between men and men to
women and all those dynamics right like
it's complicated these
these these relative dynamics that we
have to consider as we navigate through
life you know positive negative and all
the in-between um it's a lot to express
and talk about and on my channels like
i've uh you know my my book is about
introspection my whole everything is
about introspection i'm more
introspective i feel like dz focuses a
little bit more on the culture right not
that you can't be introspective or that
i can't focus on culture but that's just
the trend right
and so
um my channel is called happy chemicals
the book is called happy chemicals and
the podcast is also called happy
chemicals because it's all about me and
my relationship to my chemicals and
that's
a relationship that we all have relative
to the happenings of the outside world
right it's like
we're getting uh feedback from people
and we're having responses to it right
so just a
10 000 foot view 30 000 foot view sort
of esoteric look at that
um
when i hear the words men are trash i
have a new
i have a new relationship to that these
days because i've gone through a pretty
epic introspective journey
and
if you would ask me that maybe five
years ago maybe even two years ago i'd
have a very different probably a much
more triggered response i tend to have a
i got a pretty strong relationship with
anger there's a there's sort of an
eternal flame in my belly that's a
little bit more enneagram related than
it is just about being a man
but
as
dz started to allude to
i think any generalization
is wrong
uh and i will say that in this in like
it's
it's most truest sense that the only way
a generalization is true is if you use
the word some
and i know it's it's so cliche to like
clap back at the idea of like not all
men and that's not what i'm saying i'm
not taking that stance like that's silly
and frankly immature
but the idea that
that women have to consider that there
are
probably more dangerous men that are
seeking them that are intending
to respond to their chemicals based on
the their response to the woman walking
by
then not
to reiterate that what i mean is
that
some is always true
because humans are complicated like
humans are just
we're a hot mess we have different world
views we have different experiences we
have different personality types we have
different
experiences of mental health we have
different thought processes we have
different upbringings we have different
cultures we have different expectations
we have different expectations put upon
us
it's just it's a hotbed of a hot mess
right and so what's interesting about
this conversation is that i have
entirely no idea where to start because
the more that i think about it the more
my brain feels like a herd of cats
trying to grab on something and being
like oh this is going to be poignant
this is going to be helpful this is
going to be so great
but
it's just it's epic and it's massive but
i think
what the core ultimately gets down to
is what is my relationship to this
what is my relationship to
how
women treat themselves how what is my
relationship to how tr women treat me or
what do they expect of me or what do i
expect of them
what am i trying to get out of a
relationship with a woman from
friendship or relating or whatever right
what is
i think what i'm trying to allude to is
like radical honesty
about
what it is that i'm feeling what i'm
wanting why am i triggered first of all
so let me let me let me zone in on that
because i spent a long time being very
much triggered by
uh
women's empowerment in a lot of ways
by a lot of the metoo movement things
like that
not to say that i felt
uh that those things shouldn't happen
but that there was something in me that
didn't like that
why why didn't i like that i think
i think if i'm being radically honest i
didn't like that because i felt
inadequate as a man
and part of the ways that i tried to
create relationships with women
was through some form of trickery
or some form of making them feel
inferior to me
some form of
trying to boost myself up
and there are usually two ways to boost
some yourself up one by literally
growing as a person
not relative to anything just working on
yourself you know breathing growing
exercising eating well
uh calming your mind meditation all
those things
and then the other side of that is by
pushing someone else down that doesn't
actually lift you up that just creates a
relative experience of making someone
else smaller than you
and i will own up to the fact that a lot
of my relationship to women in the past
was about pushing them down to make me
feel better
and that's ultimately what triggered me
because whenever we're triggered
we're triggered by
some sort of
inadequacy within ourselves
or
that
trigger reminds us of something in
ourselves that we pushed down because we
felt that that's what made us a bad
person
right so if i own up to the fact that
i'm pushing women down to make myself
feel better or that i feel like i need
to trick them in order to sleep with
them
then
that is basically me saying i'm a bad
person based on my relative perception i
no longer feel that way that's just a
part of the human experience that's part
of
working through all of that stuff but at
the time if i owned that then it's like
my soul would collapse on itself and i
would my ego would just hate that i'm a
bad person and like why would i do that
and then it becomes a whole thing right
so
ultimately i feel like there's this
relationship and i'm landing in a moment
there's there's this relationship to
what we portray i think men have a
relationship to what it means to be a
good person to be a good father to be a
good
relative to a woman right a
a
friend partner
um
and then there's a relationship to bad
right whatever's good we want to portray
whatever's bad we want to hide
but whatever's bad still plays a game
it's usually referred to as shadow right
it's a shadow work it's ego shadow
relationship i feel
is
very important for a lot of men to think
about
and it really depends on your level of
development so i'm not saying catch all
don't turn this into an ideology to like
say like oh we need to improve your ego
and repress your shadow or you need to
bring out your shadow and repress your
ego it's all relative to someone's
placement and their life story right but
all i'm trying to convey is that i think
that introspective piece
is
i think where we're all trying to land
at some point is really trying to
understand and be honest with ourselves
in a way that has a positive footprint
on the reality around us
so to bring it home
at least for now uh the idea of
men are trash to me
i'm no longer triggered by because it's
just
not accurate
men as an
idea as a concept as
individuals as a collective it's just
not true this is simply not true
some men are trash yeah absolutely but
why are they trash because they're
working through stuff they maybe didn't
have a proper i don't say proper as
there's an ideal upbringing but maybe
there's
there's something in their past that
is influencing that everybody has a
karmic past a trajectory everything that
affects who they are now
uh and
everyone has
everyone has stuff and i think there's
room for an awareness within men that
men also have stuff men are not
these automatons working in coal mines
that are
you know coming home and asking for a
sandwich like that's just not the case
these days things are getting more
complex
and i think we're accepting that things
are getting more complex for more
different types of people
but
but it's almost feels like an exchange
it's like as things get more complex for
women and non-binary people and
minorities in much more complicated
situations
men are
sort of the simplified ballast of like
this can get to be complex and men get
to be simple
um
there's still kind of an unconscious
othering
and if i could reign it in i think i'm
saying that
men are sort of the publicly at least
right now the publicly acceptable
prejudice and that's unfortunate
i love so much of what you said first of
all it's really
i want to appreciate you so much
christian for being someone who is so
um both
honest and
like i see you as an abnormally honest
person and i imagine that comes from you
being abnormally honest with yourself
and by abnormally i mean like much more
so than
what i tend to see in the way that other
people talk about themselves and you
make the distinction a lot which i
really like between
operating from ego or operating from
personality and operating from shadow
and kind of what
comes up when we do both of those things
and what comes up when we don't look at
the shadow and don't look at what
kind of hidden forces or
less conscious
areas of our psyche are motivating our
behavior
and i think you do such a good job also
i want you to correct me if that's
not accurate to your
definition of shadow uh and i would like
to hear more from you on that but
that's something i love so much about
like following you on twitter just
seeing the kind of conversations that
you open up it's all about
not necessarily shaming or like blaming
the self for the bad behavior but just
really noticing it and really being
aware of
why you're being motivated to act and
behave and
show up in the way that you are and
listening to you speak
something that that kind of triggers in
me is noticing that
i think a lot of people don't realize
when they're not
authentically relating to each other and
i think that that's where a lot of this
really
gets messy is when we're relating to
each other from a place of ego to ego
and i would say anytime any one person
is calling another person trash
whether like
man woman non-binary any gender any
person when you're placing that kind of
generalization on someone you're really
not looking at the whole person and
what's going into even the insecurities
that they're acting on
and i think that we don't get to a place
where we can
i don't think we're ever going to fully
solve any social issue but where we can
have shared understandings between
genders between different groups of
people in general if we're not
understanding the whole picture of
what's driving and motivating everybody
and i so appreciate that you go there
all the time and i imagine you to be
quite
critical of your own shadow and that's i
think inspiring to watch and inspiring
for other people to
um
like take a look at themselves in that
same way so i really appreciate that
that's already where you've taken this
and i want to hear a lot more about what
you think
comes up for you i guess in that chat
work that might be relevant to other men
as well yeah i i appreciate that i i
want to emphasize the noticing part
because it's really
like
when you start playing with shadow stuff
and and i should emphasize too that this
usually happens later in someone's
development like in in buddhism you have
to develop an ego they express at least
you have to develop an ego before you
can start to tear it down
and and there's reasons for that we
develop an ego we develop a sense of
self we develop a sense of what's good
uh what we feel we have to be to become
a good person relative to things like
our personality and things that we
necess don't necessarily have uh control
over
but what we decide or what the world
informs us is good or bad and then
having this kind of push pull and then
you have to like you can't necessarily
just let the shadow out
because you have to exist in a society
right like
if i were to just completely give in to
my unconscious impulses and run out
naked in the street and just start
screaming like that would not be
socially acceptable and there's a
relationship i have to form to that to
like
you know that has to exist for a society
to function
but as you start to develop later in
your life and maybe you are less
dependent on society in terms of getting
your resources and your needs met maybe
you have your own your own business and
go through a lot of ethical stuff like
you're getting into a place where
now you can start to
what i think ken wilber calls clean up
work which is like going through your
past and kind of looking at the places
where you shortcut it right like
where have i taken a shortcut
in my development and left things behind
me in a way like
i think i've heard the expression that
the shadow is the bag that you drag
behind you and as you're going going
forward in life you're putting
things that you feel are not going to be
a good presentation of yourself into the
bag but you're still dragging it it's
still and it's getting heavier and
heavier and as you go through life and
develop your life
at some point you're going to start
picking through it and either
integrating things or discarding things
and having to do some work to
to to figure out what some of those
things are and what they mean etc so i
want to emphasize this like noticing
part because
it's really easy or it could be easy for
me to be like
noticing
that i have this relationship to women
or i've had this relationship to women
where i
make them smaller conceptually for me to
lord over them or have some sort of
relationship where i can trick them into
sleeping with me quote unquote
once i realize that i can totally
demolish myself
about that which i think is it's just
natural that's gonna happen you're gonna
feel some sort of like
this feels awful i feel like an awful
person why would i do this i never
thought i could be capable of this etc
but at some point
there is this
feeling of
acceptance
that there's a reason there's there's
reasons that i did that that was my
strategy
to get what i felt was a need that i had
met
and that's not necessarily excusing the
behavior
but it's also
not enabling it anymore
it's sort of i see you i see you
i see you doing this thing
we don't need to do that anymore we
don't need to do that anymore because
now we can start to develop
self-confidence in other territories
like this was a compensation for my
self-confidence my relationship with
women in terms of
of the accomplishments of of you know
uh uh
notches on the bed post as it were
like
those are just like hanging pelts on the
wall right which sounds so crude but
it's
kind of the idea right
uh and so
when i'm when doing this sort of
noticing
it's easy to go the other direction and
start to beat myself up to the point
where
i emasculate myself the goal is the
other direction it's not to
the reason this happened in the first
place is because i was either
either not owning my masculinity growing
up or something with my mother or my
father there's stories i could probably
hash out and tell in more specific
detail but we don't have time for that
but uh
essentially
you know if i'm
taking noticing this and saying like i
did this because i don't feel like a
grown ass man
then now it's time to work on becoming a
grown ass man becoming mature becoming
you know improving my self-esteem
because it's easy to go in the other
direction and say like
and and really kind of become whiny
about it in a sense and i'm not saying
not feel your feelings because being
mature as a man is feeling your feelings
and processing them and and expressing
them
but turning what i'm saying is turning
that into another ego thing turning that
into
[Music]
uh almost what i've seen
men start to do in relationship to the
men are trash you know idea
which is converting it into another way
to get women to sleep with them just
like oh i'm such an awful man
come into my room
i'm so terrible you should just yeah you
should just show me how awful i am like
it's just it just becomes another thing
um but there's a difference between
uh
bringing up the shadow and using that
versus noticing it
pointing at it saying i see what you're
doing and then saying like okay what is
this trying to tell us what is it we're
not actually bringing into ourselves and
you know in my case it was a
it was a self-confidence it was a
self-esteem it was uh
a belief that i'm attractive that i can
that i can be
attractive
to people that it's not an inherent
belief within me that i'm not attractive
that i'm never deserving of
love of support of relating of sexual
attention etc you're right it's really
just like
reconstructing that philosophy within
myself
yeah i'm gonna stop or i'll just keep
going forever
i feel like i could listen for a long
time i appreciate that
i really like that you use the term
unmet needs
quite a bit and i kind of see like the
conversation beneath this conversation
as
which unmet needs are largely going
addressed let's say for men as a whole
in society
and how does that kind of turn into this
i guess idea that we have of men as
always behaving badly or or in or kind
of this idea that men are
very often just trying to put women down
or trick women as you said i think that
comes from a real place and i think
there is absolutely a similar set of
i guess like tricks and and kind of
um shortcuts that women take to get
their needs met that they don't want to
voice directly i think the reason why it
can be more
difficult i guess for men to
potentially state what they need and
want directly is because there just
isn't a lot of conversation around that
like i think women have more
conversations in their friendships just
in general in society about their
emotions their unmet needs and i don't
always think that those conversations
are
completely healthy or completely fair
um
but i imagine that for men there's
probably less of those conversations
happening
and so i would imagine that gives rise
to this kind of like you have the whole
like red pill society thing where it's
all about this like
getting your needs met in manipulative
ways and hiding who you actually are and
i imagine
that
type of
like personal development being what i
see as kind of historically the most
prevalent like when you when you google
or like
hear about
personal development for men a lot of it
is just like how to do more ego tricks
and i would imagine that feels very
um
lonely frustrating
um like if that were the kind of only
option to get connection i imagine
anyone would take it
but i'm curious about what's kind of the
flip side of that how do you integrate
more of what's actually happening for
you and the needs that you actually have
in a way
that
feels like it's possible within the
society that we live in where we don't
really talk about men's emotions men's
needs or where men's needs are seen as
kind of
um
predatory a lot of the time like i'm
curious about
what any of that sparks in either view
denzel um
maybe i'm curious about what you're
thinking at this point
yeah uh
i really first and foremost just loved
what christian said
um
well all of what he said but especially
about the idea
of you're not lifting yourself up by
pushing someone else down you're just
kind of like changing you know the
perspective in that way um and also his
radical honesty with himself
even when it comes like women's
empowerment um i think that's huge like
for me i know just about maybe like a
couple months ago um
this was something that me and my wife
jamila we were talking about like we
were just driving
one morning and uh i don't even remember
like how it started off as a joke and
then it became like a more serious
conversation but
i think we were listening to a song and
then
uh
a woman like who was in the song i
forgot what it was but she said
something
and then i made a comment about it
um and then we were kind of just like
joking at first but then it turned again
like it's like something that's like
wait so do you really think this and
boom boom
and
jamila likes like play
jokes in a way kind of like straw man i
guess like oh so what you're saying is
and i'm like
that's not entirely what i'm saying but
to an extent yeah i'm not saying that i
don't support women's empowerment i'm
just saying that we can empower women
without
pushing down men and then she's like but
if the patriarchy is boom boom i'm like
i understand i think the patriarchy is
horrible and this is that but like we
should separate the patriarchy in the
system
from
just men you know what i mean and then i
kind of even related it back to like you
know racism in a way it's like
i don't have any problem with black
people me especially being a black
person empowering ourselves especially
after all that we've went through but
when i see post they're like yeah black
people are the elite
or something like it's like come on like
what do you think
is gonna come from that you know i don't
think that martin luther king jr came
and tried to get black people to be like
this over white people i think that he
instead tried to get black people to be
like this like hey we are all
even and so in the same sense with men
and women i think that yes women
unfortunately because of men were over
here maybe even lower due to the
patriarchy um but now it's time that we
lift them and i should not be upset with
women getting over here i want that to
happen
but when women you know start doing this
and they start doing this then it's like
i
know this is probably biased as a man
but i don't think that we should be
doing that like because then we're just
going to keep on trying to one-up each
other and i don't like i don't like
one-ups like i think that it's really
immature and so uh you know some like
one of the examples i threw to her was
like yeah you know beyonce's uh song i
love beyonce still listened to her loved
her recent album and everything but her
song who runs the world girls and like i
was like reading some of the lyrics off
to jamila i'm like like these lyrics are
really like some of these lyrics are
really unnecessary and so to answer your
question heidi of like what do i
feel when i read stuff like men are
trash and stuff like that it's kind of
like i'm here like oh men are useless
like oh yeah you know
again so many tweets that are like like
what if what if we just had a world
without men it's like dang it's like uh
oh you know what just get your vibrator
girl what dang like you know um oh you
know we are the ones who bring birth and
like uh babies into the world and stuff
like that okay and i'm just
here you know like i'm just a sack of
potatoes like on the couch or whatever
sure you know like
i don't know and even i think and there
was so much unlearning that i had to do
as well that i also take part in like i
will literally never forget
coincidentally it was you heidi you
probably don't even remember
but um some a woman on twitter i learned
so much from twitter i just like seeing
all people's opinions and stuff and then
being like huh to get outside of my own
world view but uh a woman on twitter
like years ago heidi is uh she tweeted
about how like her two guy friends are
always like you know with her and they
respect her and they protect her and
stuff like that um and uh they hold the
door for her whatever
and i said that i quoted it and i said
something like this is how i believe it
should be like whether it's a romantic
relationship or just a friendship like
you should show this kind of respect and
treat the woman like as a queen
um to me i saw that as like yo we're
empowering women we're like we're we're
respecting them but then heidi you
quoted it and you said something on the
lines of like
well why does the man have to do this
for women and you know why can't women
do this i'm like
i mean that's a good point i wasn't
saying that women can't do this for men
i'm not gonna get mad if a woman like
holds the door for me like
what i'm supposed to do that for you
like you know like but i also could
understand like and i saw some
several people like like your tweet and
i was like yeah this is a perspective i
hadn't really thought of i just mainly
focus on myself like this is what i'm
going to do for women
but that was also one of the first days
that when i started to really think
about and i started seeing other
people's conversation around it a lot of
women said that men a lot of times use
such tactics like holding the door for
them and everything like that as a way
to like put themselves above them and
show like oh you are weaker or you are
below me
that blew my mind and i was like i
wonder how many times i've accidentally
given that message out to a woman and i
had no idea i thought it was just being
polite
and so
women a lot of times you know could
think that maybe i'm even like hitting
on them or something and like and it's
like oh i understand now
why
they could think that but it really
sucks that just because i held the door
for you or just because i liked your
photo or just because you know i gave
you this compliment that i would also
give a guy like you know i'm looking at
christian i'm like man i can't wait till
my beard connects like his like if i
tell him like yo man i really like your
beard or something like
am i hitting on christian you know so
yes you are
right
thank you but
[Laughter]
like if you if you uh if you're a woman
and most of the men that have said
certain comments or compliments to you
are trying to be like yeah so now that
i've said this thing about your hair
heidi um
then it's like oh well no wonder and how
can they tell the difference between
that man and then me
and that's what i kind of meant recently
like oh all this just sucks
that we've come to this point um but i i
want to fix that i want us to be able to
be like
yes
there are definitely men that are like
that out there um but kind of like once
again like what christian said
i wonder how much we're paying attention
to the bad apples
and not like really like
you know how much the good ones which
you know we're not supposed to reward
how you're supposed to just be but i
feel like if we're in a world where it
seems like
most of the men are bad
then maybe we should reward
more of like the men who are just
how they're supposed to be
because going back to that unmet need
a lot of these men that were bad
i feel like
again like they they're they're missing
something from them growing up
in a way and it's like oh if we're if
they don't if the men who are just doing
what they're supposed to do are catching
stray bullets all the time
um but then the ones who are not doing
what they're supposed to do they're
supposedly getting what they want while
still being attacked and they're looking
at the the good men
um and also being like well you're not
much better off than i am then what
incentive really is there and it
shouldn't be like this we shouldn't have
to reward men for it
but i feel like that's kind of where we
might have to start and this is just me
like ideating here um
but yeah so that's that's one of the
main things that you know i think i
think about you know talking about you
know like the men are trash thing and
then tying in like the unmet need thing
um and then even lastly like i made a
video a couple years ago called
apologizing on the behalf of wicked men
and what kind of sprung that video was
like again my ignorance is a guy and
i've seen a another tweet
that you know oh what if uh it was like
posing a question like what if men um
had a curfew at nine o'clock
every night um how would how would you
change women or like like what would
that change for you women and in my guy
mind i read it and i was thinking stuff
like oh maybe they're going to respond
things like oh i guess that means i'll
get ready quicker
when we're going out on dates or you
know i don't know i didn't know what to
really think i was just thinking along
those lines like oh let me take less
time with my makeup because we only have
till 9 pm
i saw women commenting things like oh i
would actually not be afraid to go to
the gas station or i could actually take
a walk or i can do this
i was like that broke my heart because i
was not even thinking
that way and i was like wow
i knew that women felt
endangered
a lot of times by men but like man like
it's to like this extent
that's that's crazy and it's so sad
that yeah you know if i see for example
like at the gas station a woman needs
help with something
and it's at night
how does she know that if i'm
approaching her it's like hey you know
do you need like how does she know that
i'm not some man that's about to do
something like she doesn't know that she
can't help that she has to be on guard
because that's what life has taught her
and i don't blame her for it but as a
man i also feel like
that just sucks
and so
that's that's what everything comes down
to and it's like okay i hope that
there's a way
that we can
buffer this and help it in a certain
manner
yeah so much of that
is interesting on multiple different
levels because what we're kind of
getting into is
not just the individual
character of like
one man at a time right i think we're
looking at a whole system and how
the way that
i guess men have been socialized
might be making women uncomfortable
without
them even realizing it and i imagine
that's more often the case like i think
that
that's a great example of you
approaching someone at a gas station
like if if a random man were to approach
me at a gas station i'd be like i don't
know
what this motive is right and it could
be a wonderful human being who's just
there to ask me a question or something
but there is that twinge of of anxiety
and
i think what's interesting is like i've
had a lot of conversations recently i
feel like
with the men in my life because this is
just i think a big topic at this point
like men's mental health and and how
the social situation that we're in at
large affects it
and i think that a lot of men feel like
okay well i'm consciously doing my
absolute best to be very fair and very
kind and very considerate towards women
and i completely and totally believe
that for the most part i think it's
the absolute
i would say the absolute exception but
it's the exception when you have men
that are out there like
fully entrenched in like all of these
social games of like putting down women
and trying to trick them like yes there
are absolutely those men
but i think that
the vast majority of men that at least i
interact with i think really are trying
their best to make women comfortable and
to be reasonably self-aware about how
they're doing that
and i think that where the backlash
tends to come from
is kind of like women wanting men to be
aware of
the ways in which it's just different
for them in the world
that a lot of men don't notice and i
would and and like denzel i like that
you
i've heard you a few times equate this
to racism like if i were to hear the
term white people are trash i'm like
well
i have this conscious idea of myself as
someone who is not racist right but
that also doesn't mean that i fully
understand what it feels like to be a
person of color and to navigate the
world
from a completely different perspective
which i imagine has a lot of like tiny
moments that i'm not tuned into
and i think that
what it comes down to is like as a woman
i do imagine that there are so many like
vulnerabilities that women feel
daily that men just they they don't feel
the same vulnerabilities because they
live in a different world and i think
you guys feel different vulnerabilities
and i think that there's a lot of anger
when it comes to the way that men and
women in particular
approach each other like the more i have
these conversations i feel like
men are like well women don't understand
this about us and our vulnerabilities
and like let's say how scary it is to
approach a woman and all of these
thoughts that are going through our
heads about our own
self-worth and how women are going to
respond to us and then on the flip side
women are like well you don't understand
the vulnerabilities that we constantly
have dealing with men
and i think that that's what a lot of
this conversation comes down to is we
aren't aware of
which like deeper unmet needs and
vulnerabilities are often driving our
social interactions
and that's why i find it so interesting
to hear both of you speak on this topic
because i think that
women are a little bit more
like we're socialized to be a little bit
more forthcoming about what we feel
vulnerable about
and i would say actually the women's
empowerment movement in some ways has uh
like disempowered women to talk about
their vulnerabilities
but i think historically men have talked
so little about that and so little about
what's in their shadow and what comes up
for them and
in various different interactions
that i think we end up with yeah all of
these like social games where people are
trying to have their needs and
vulnerabilities addressed and met by the
other without explicitly stating what
they are
and kristin that's something that i
feel like you've been talking about
recently like you were chatting with
denzel and i the other day about this
idea of like unmet
um
mother wounds in men that kind of end up
getting like kind of leaking out of them
socially because we don't talk
explicitly about the needs that go unmet
for men
or like the transition into manhood
um
and i'm curious if you a if you want to
speak on that or b
if anything else that we've said so far
has sparked a reaction in you
yeah oh that's so much there's so many
things like it's it's just it's a lot
it's like being a human being is a lot
it's hard there's a lot of things
not only a lot of things you have to be
as an individual
but then relative to your parents or to
society or to someone you want to
attract or your friends that you're
trying to fit into or
your customers or whatever right
like we're always having to take
whatever our instinctual whatever and
try to transmogrify it into something
palatable or something
acceptable right and i think that starts
from as young as you know a toddler
right so there's this really great model
that i'm not going to go into and i'm
telling myself that
called the stages model
uh it's kind of like spiral dynamics
integral theory but it's about person
perspective meaning first person
perspective me i am the subject and
everything else is the object second
person perspective i am a subject and
i am
i'm a subject to you and you are subject
to me like we're aware that each other
has
perspectives and it goes on down the
line uh when you're a toddler you know
you're mostly just focused on your world
you're just like i i have tensions and
releases that need to happen i need to
poop and i'm just i just do it and
i'm hungry so i need to cry until my
tension is relieved right there's just
tension and release and you're just
perceiving things and that's all you're
doing but there's this point when you're
getting into a territory we're starting
to kind of notice that other people
exist when you're a really little kid
and
you know whatever the circumstances
around you
is what's going to inform
your relationship to how other
subjects or objects i should say in your
view are interacting what i mean is
like you're getting a sense of what it's
like to be
like if you're a young little boy you're
a little toddler
and
kids are always a little focused on
their their physical parts and it's
usually like the sexual organs it's like
i've got a penis and you're like what is
that you see your mom for the first time
you're like what's going on there and
like
there's like this this situation there's
this suddenly there's not only this
other in terms of a person but other in
terms of like another body exists
another and then subconsciously you're
picking on like another energy exists
like there's a
and you're starting to formulate this
perception of
what it's like to
be you're making a core like easy
correlations like when you're young and
your basic sense of logic is just like
okay one plus one two okay
uh and what i mean is
if you're a little boy and you see your
father doing stuff you're like okay i'm
gonna grow up to be that or maybe i'm
going to grow up to be the opposite of
that or some healthy in between of that
or if you see your mother and the way
that she relates to you and she treats
you
you're going to most likely expect or
hope that
other women that you come in into
contact with are going to behave like
that or treat you like that if it's a
positive thing it's a negative thing
you're going to want to avoid that at
all costs or it becomes a shadow
and so what i'm kind of alluding to is
that
there's this concept that goes into
much deeper unconscious stuff called
anima animus
which is really about a relating
function and i want to kind of set the
stage real quick in saying that
i'm trying to personally
evolve some of this
understanding so this is a little bit of
conjecture
but i personally and you guys can please
give me your thoughts on this
i don't think masculinity and femininity
is necessarily tied to male and female
right like i don't think
because you're born a male you're
automatically
going to embody a masculine energy by
default
uh
you know and when we have relationships
to like kind of thinking and feeling or
analytic and holistic maybe more
it's kind of an expansion expansion and
compression that's like kind of a
elements of the universe in a sense like
there's
you know
there's a spark of an idea and there's
creativity and there's expansion and
there's flow and there's movement
and then there's compression and there's
like channeling through and let's get
this stuff done it's kind of thinker
feeler yin yang that sort of thing i
don't necessarily feel masculine and
feminine are automatically tied to male
and female in that sense
so setting the stage in that way
and so i think we learn
what
what our attunement is or what it means
to be masculine or feminine or male or
female
a by socialization by
and i don't mean socialization by like
the bigger picture social world because
we don't usually interact with the
bigger picture social world until we're
at least teenagers
it's a lot of it is relative to family
and the family environment so if you're
surrounded by a father who is
overbearing
and intense
you may either
and and you have this relationship with
your mother where she's treating you as
a precious little angel and you need to
be quiet and calm to get your needs met
you may
you may actually see the father as the
villain as fear as something you fear
and you don't want to be that but that
maybe then becomes a shadow of yourself
because it's something you still
experience and you still take in
right
so uh there's things called father and
mother complexes which it's complex as
it sounds uh but that's like the base
idea is that there are these
relationships that we have to our
parents growing up whether like
the mom treated you as a perfect little
angel or she beat you
and you don't have a safe relationship
to women and maybe you want to have a
dominating relationship to women
or maybe you were able to manipulate
your mom to get whatever you want and
that translates later into feeling like
you need to manipulate women to be able
to get what you want i'm not pointing
fingers at myself i'm just saying that's
what happens
um
so
you know there are these relationships
that i think
did i freeze i think i froze on the
screen okay i'll keep talking here for a
second
um it's really really flattering image
by the way
but but in a sense uh you know i'm
feeling that
uh
our relationships to our parents are
some of the first early relationships
that we have to go on
when it comes to relating
to either the archetype that we want to
become or not want to become
or the
who
our relationship to
the i don't know mostly the opposite sex
but maybe the complimentary energy the
complimentary sex the other one
because again if you're growing up and
you kind of develop more of a feminine
energy as a male maybe later in life you
need to formulate more of a masculine uh
bring some of the masculinity in which i
think is some of my relationship i kind
of leaned more into using feminine
tactics
of being a little bit more emotionally
manipulative
not saying that that's
you know concretely a feminine thing but
more of a
fluid tactic i should say versus
being more direct and attractive and you
know
being more
a
resource provider typical
man in a suit kind of guy
uh i kind of lost my train of thought
but i hope that makes some sort of sense
while i try to fix my camera because i'm
distracted by it yeah it does to me for
sure
um oh well i'll let heidi say what she
was gonna say first
oh i was actually gonna uh
bat it
you're down on my screen so down to you
dance up but um because it was reminding
me of the video
you did a video on this topic on the
topic of men or trash and part of what
you were saying in it was
that there aren't a lot of examples of
like okay well what is like a let's say
emotionally healthy integrated man what
does that look like yeah and i know that
you
have had some kind of like thoughts and
conversations around that and you were
talking about a book you were reading
before we got started so i was curious
if you wanted to pick that up um and of
course feel free to yeah respond to
anything else in there but i think
that's a really interesting
place to pivot to is like well what are
we aiming for like what is a good
picture of mental health for men and as
like a full integrated being yeah that's
that's exactly where i was pretty much
going to go like so the book that i'm
reading is man enough by justin baldoni
um and i love the subtitle it's
undefining my masculinity so instead of
redefining it like this is what a man is
supposed to look like he's like how
about we just
not even box ourselves into that because
it's kind of going back to what
christian was saying like okay hey
you're back um
what
like
are men born with masculinity or women
born with femininity stuff like that and
i think that we need both you know when
we look at the um archetypes uh honestly
my top two that i relate to the most are
aphrodite and heart and hermes and i
related more to aphrodite than i even
did to hermes um and i remember a few
years ago when i first got into it and i
was being honest with myself when i
identified that i was like oh man like
but i'm supposed to be men like you know
like and i was really like
perturbed by that and then you know i've
grown more into being like yo like
man or woman aphrodite was pretty badass
like so it doesn't even matter and i'm
still who i am
and it's for a reason um and so yeah
like what is a you know
man supposed to look like then you know
like as if nowadays once again going
back to that holding the door and stuff
like that like a lot of things that men
thought they were supposed to look like
now is a lot of times being like you
know like oh you're not supposed to do
that you're not supposed to do that it's
like okay well then but then if i cry
then it's like oh well you know now
you're weak and so and this kind of goes
into like you know one of the last
things i was thinking about that i was
debating bringing up but i think that
we've laid enough foundation where
essentially i think that women play a
part
in toxic masculinity
um that's not once again to attack women
but just to help you know understand and
unpack that a little bit more um i think
that you know a lot of what men become
is to impress women
you know a lot of times like they're
like they're looking at women and if
anything they're trying to gain more
women and you know stuff like that and
it's just very paradoxical it's like
they'll disrespect women in order to
gain respect from them at times and also
from other men too
but i think that when
men see
certain things like women talking like
yeah i love it when a man does this for
me i love it when a man does that then a
man is now like oh let me try to do that
but then they're doing it to get
something from the woman a lot of times
and then the woman's like oh what are
you doing and then it's like oh well i
thought you know
what do i do then and it just causes a
lot of confusion there i remember
um i invented one time um on my private
twitter account about like just to you
know make it still keep it like g-rated
but like there was there was at least
like two women that i would like sex
with in the past
and the way that like they they tried to
bring
the uh the interactions into a more kind
of
abusive and you know just like like very
i don't know i just wasn't really like
into it in that way
but then their kind of stance
was like oh well if you're not into this
then you're kind of beta male like they
didn't say that like directly
but that was like what they were
implying and instead like you know they
would go to a man who's more like yeah
i'm gonna choke you and i'm gonna you
know call you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's like
what
but then it's like all right well if
you're a man that's not like conditioned
to be like well if i'm not showing this
kind of women are dumb and i'm gonna you
know be disrespectful to you in a way
type of energy
then women are going to think of you as
weak
and not assertive and a little b word
and stuff like that um because you're
this nice guy that's really respectful
and all that but then when you start to
take on that personality then these same
women will now go and like you know talk
about ah i can't believe you know
there's men who out here who just you
know they've left that every opportunity
to uh to uh put me in a submissive
position and this is that and it's like
well i kind of didn't even want to do
that you kind of made me
and it's like i think once again when
you have like male friends and you speak
to them and you know hey you know how is
your relationship with them and boom
boom
they start to really get to a point like
where they'll share a lot of these
things like
man you know like my girl like she uh i
had or there was this girl that i was
going after and you know she went after
this other dude you know and i remember
i was listening to a tupac interview and
if you watch an interview of tupac like
when he was 17 he was very different
from how you know
he was before he died like we all see
tupac's like oh he has thug written on
him and he's like very assertive and
aggressive
but there's a video when he hit him when
he was like 17
and he's like
kind of effeminate and he's like yeah
you know and i i was always like you
know i was with these girls and like you
know i know like they date men who call
them the b word like he literally was
like that he was like ah and he said and
i was trying to date with this woman and
she said that i was too nice
like wow
she didn't like me because i was too
nice and she was like okay you know she
wants somebody who's masculine like i'm
masculine you know and
next thing you know like that same video
it showed him like a few years later and
he's talking about yo if those
boom and he's like just
acting very
aggressive
and it's like
man
what really led him to be that way
because he literally said in the video
like so after that happened i was just
like you know what
forget it then i'm gonna be like the men
that these women say that they want
and so once again i i don't think that's
always the case i don't really think
it's as much of a chicken like which
came first the chicken or the egg thing
i do think that men probably started off
like way back then being cavalier in
this way
but then women got conditioned to like
oh this is how a man is supposed to be
like then they're also saying like i
don't want a man that's like this and so
then the men who are trying to not be
cavalier they're like all right well let
me show you more respects what well
you're not being like that man it's like
okay well let me be a little bit more
cavalier it's like oh well you're not
being respectful and it's like what do
you want from me
so yeah i mean and that's the i'm that's
the paradox of the growing up process
right like pendulum swinging like i
tried this
it didn't work let me do the opposite
it didn't work and it's almost like as
we're growing up and developing in life
we're just pendulum swinging a bunch of
stuff back and forth and then we finally
eventually settle down
and find some sort of integration point
some sort of whatever our version of a
middle ground is of like
contextually or all the time or like
intentional like really getting to know
what our intentions are maybe starting
to develop value systems and value codes
for ourselves
and really starting to
figure out circumstances and situations
that
you know this calls for more of a
masculine energy this calls for more of
a feminine energy or this calls for some
version of in between things become more
uh on a sliding scale as opposed to
you know i was i was trying the tactic
of being gentle so that i can
have a
more of a relating energy with these
women and maybe that'll eventually lead
to a sexual thing sure but like i'm
trying to connect with you and i'm
trying to vibe with you
and then like oh you're finding out
that's a rejected thing with the people
that you were talking to because maybe
that was too far in one direction and
then you're like okay let me try on this
other suit and see if this works
and give it a go right
and i think i think one of the
challenges is that like
there's a lot of resistance to what is a
very natural process a very natural
process of growing up making mistakes
and trying to figure stuff out
um and obviously
making mistakes has consequences meaning
a man making a mistake
can be very dire or
fatal for a woman if it's too
awful of a mistake right
and i mean this is true for anybody but
in the particular case of men
over women for lack of a better way to
put it
you know that can be a very dangerous
game to play and so it's really
i keep harping on this idea that it's
complicated because i feel like the idea
of men are trash is trying to
oversimplify or in a way like over
masculinize
relating it's it's trying to put people
into a pipeline of saying like men need
to be like this this this and this they
need to stop doing this they need to say
this this way they need to do this this
way
it's a little bit religionizing it's a
little bit
an expectation of conformity to
trying to define a singular narrative of
the way that men should be
and
it's in a way treating men the way that
they feel men are which is
simple and singular i say they in an
esoteric sense but it's not it's i'm i'm
speaking of like the collective
unconscious archetype in a sense that
we're referring to because i know not
every woman has this opinion
either right
uh so when we're talking about this men
or trash thing there's this like
there's a word called agrigore
negra gore is like a
it's actually a supernatural term which
is kind of funny but it's a a term used
for
when a collective energy of a space
creates an entity because everyone
believes that the entity lives there
right it's like this phenomenon of
everyone believes that everyone else
believes something but no one else
actually believes it so like the thing
exists
but if you talk to an individual
their relationship is much more
complicated it's not just saying like
this thing is real
or men are trash like if you actually
get into the
the the works of it you find that there
are much more complicated nuanced things
where that like someone saying that men
are trash may mean that they have an
unconscious unhealthy relationship with
their own inner masculinity whether
that's men or women because it's not or
anyone in between
because as i said masculine and feminine
and
i firmly believe are not necessarily
tied to male and female
and if you're able
play more in that nuanced space which i
think a lot of people are in in a
persona sense but maybe not in an
internal sense
you know it's
things things are
life is complicated but in order to try
to make social change or to make
movements happen or to try to
make the world more comfortable for a
particular type of person
it it involves a lot of energy and it
evolves a lot of corralling
emotionally physically
etc
um
and
i had a thought and i lost it but
essentially i feel like there's this
there's there's a
there's like a corralling of energy to
try to
force a singular ideal through
of
men need to be this way and that's just
that's more of the same in my opinion
i also noticed like as a woman i feel
like there's the same struggle in terms
of like what people say they want
like when i talk to men they're like oh
i always want women to be more assertive
i want them to approach i want them to
pursue more
and i feel like in the past i've been
like what i feel like when i do that
then there's this whole set of
assumptions that comes with it like it's
like okay if you're a woman who's more
assertive the only thing you're
interested in is sex let's say and as
someone who just doesn't really enjoy
casual sex that much i'm like no i'm i
like to be assertive socially like i
like to start conversations i like to
approach people i'm interested in but
then there's this whole like we we
attach all of these things to other
things and i imagine
the same is probably true for
like it kind of sounds like when we're
asking men to be let's say
um
more considerate more thoughtful in
their communication whatever it is then
there's also this assumption in the
collective that that means okay they're
less masculine or they have less
masculine energy and it sounds like
there's a lot of like mixed signals i
think for both for all
and for all genders and non-binary
people there's just this giant
conflict internally of like okay how do
i be all things because we are all all
things like christian like you were
saying i completely agree that
we all have like masculine and feminine
energies within us
and i think that
because we're almost socially resistant
to the fact that like
everyone has all of that and we're
always trying to fit people into these
like specific archetypes or like a
specific type of man a specific type of
woman there's so much getting lost and i
think that that has a really negative
impact on everybody's mental health
like when men can't
be both masculine and also vulnerable
when women can't be both assertive and
also
feminine like there's so much that gets
lost and that we stop communicating to
each other because we're all trying to
like fit into
what we think other people want us to be
and then we can't like authentically
relate
and i think that that's where a lot of
this ends up
devolving into these like really intense
criticisms of other genders or other
like
social like social roles i guess that we
want each other to play
is that we just don't have the ability
to hold space for all of it
yes
yeah yeah and i feel like
that's where it all comes down to like
as of right now i don't think that we
actually have a solution
i think that you know long term the
solution would be like let's
be clear
on what do we actually
want
as a collective maybe to expect from a
man and to expect from a woman but then
also hold space for when they're not
bringing that and understand why
um but
to actually define that as a collective
is like that's going to take a really
long time you know and in order to even
get there the first step
is kind of what we're doing now like
well let's first
make it clear how
we've been trying to be these things for
each other and just keep on missing each
other there and then we assign ill
intentions
on to the other and then we get mad and
then we retaliate defensively and that
just causes even more of a problem so
how about instead let's
back away from always assigning ill
intentions
and let's actually just try to better
understand the other instead of just
outright calling them trash instead of
just outright you know like you know
saying oh forget that
female or whatever term that you might
use
instead
uh push yourself more onto um
okay let's uh
what's the word um well yeah let's let's
let's let's come to an understanding
let's try to agree with this and every
relationship every dynamic every person
is going to be different it's not a
problem if you want a man who is more
cavalier and
masculine in that way like and like if
you want that like that's fine
um but let's also then try to make space
for the people who do want that versus
the people who want men that are more of
like this other way um
and yeah let's let's i guess let's just
breed more of a grounds for
understanding as opposed to attacking
defensively um because that i feel like
that doesn't solve anything just just
telling it yeah we're trash oh great
thanks like
like that's that's encouraging me to be
better like no that's just that's just
making me oh yeah well you're trash too
you know and your mom is i don't know
like it's just petty like that's not
solving the issue
i think that this issue would best be
resolved
in a place of like
just being kind of like more civil you
can express the passion that you have
and like how you feel
but let's not attack the other person
and that goes for both sides like men
should not attack women because we need
to understand where they're coming from
um and you we need to do better like
stop giving them reasons
to say these things
you know but then also women i feel
should try to be more patient
it shouldn't be this way i want to
emphasize that because i know there's
going to be women well you know why
shouldn't be more
it shouldn't be that way but if we
actually want a solution i think that
we we need to do
what it shouldn't be
which you know is the same thing like
you know again like going back to race
like with black people i see a lot of
like you know black people oh yeah you
know we shouldn't have to educate white
people on you know this this is that and
i tell those same black people like well
you're gonna be the same person who gets
mad when the white person goes to google
to find their answers and then they
start you know spreading more of this
information because you didn't educate
them yes we shouldn't have to educate
white people on our experience or
whatever
but
we
that's how that's that's what it is this
is what reality is so if we want this
problem to stop
then stop with the we shouldn't have to
and just do it
yeah i think i think an important
principle for me personally that i think
is
is i'm still testing if it's valuable
for others but
is this idea of of seeking and
supporting sovereignty within myself and
others like i feel like if there's an
ultimate goal that i have right now
it's that in every situation i i'm in
every person i'm talking to or every
system or context
i'm hoping to seek and support
sovereignty meaning
that everyone is in some sort of process
everyone is in some sort of stage
everyone is in some sort of
level everyone has a personality or an
avatar or persona or
growing up work to do
everyone's in some sort of complicated
prison of their own making and
in my mind i feel that
first of all peace takes a lot of work
peace is always about the outer world we
when we have conversations like these
related to
masculine and feminine dynamics uh race
related sexuality related etc there's
always some relationship to like what is
the solution what is what leads to peace
and
like what does that even mean what does
peace even mean like it's a utopia it's
like
it's it's an ideal it's a it's a part of
a reality that doesn't actually exist
like to me peace
is sovereignty it's everyone being able
to navigate the world the way that they
need to
without
impeding on other people's sovereignty
right
like someone
who's at a gas station trying to fill up
their gas tank like
supporting sovereignty is helping them
out if they need help like i'll go talk
to the gas station attendant instead of
coming up to them
maybe go talk to the gas station
attendant and
you know maybe someone official can come
and help instead of you
um
disrupting sovereignty is
kidnapping that person
like to be blunt right
uh
i think you know the idea of
what is considered criminal what is what
is uh
what is considered criminal gets
infected by ideologies all the time
there are things that people go to jail
for that are legit
like have impeded on people's
sovereignty and their own sovereignty
and then there are other situations
where
people didn't harm anyone by selling
weed or something like that and then now
they're in jail and
that's nonsense right
a part of what happened particularly
after george floyd is
is this
sudden awareness that because of the
times that we're in that we have
technology that we have
this ability to speak out this ability
to express ourselves at scale that
we can now
take sovereignty into our own hands at
least that's the perspective i imagine a
lot of black lives have taken
that
i am
not necessarily like a lot of middlemen
a lot of middlemen which happen to be
older white men are now being removed or
have been removed by
technology the advancement of business
or by being found in criminal cases or
by harming women or or
taking advantage of their power and
position
etc right
anyone who has been impeding the natural
flow of the rhythms of society and
sovereignty they're getting weeded out
that's just what happens
that's sort of a natural rhythm of
humanity that's a natural rhythm of
evolution
that
it's just going to happen
uh i think in this case
when it comes to
the ideas of of
men are trash i feel like
there is
it's at least stirring the pot
and that's something i appreciate i
appreciate that because it has us have
this conversation first of all which i'm
really grateful for
and second of all
it maybe makes mental consider a lot of
like what is the avatar that they should
be wearing you know it kind of depends
on your stage of development what that
means like you know for someone who is a
teenager who's trying to figure out what
their favorite
color is what their favorite anime is
what kind of hairstyle they want they're
trying on different avatars to see
what is acceptable what gets them what
they want gets them where they want to
go gets them to fit into the society
that they want to be fit into
uh and then someone eventually
transmutes into like a
vocation right like you know i'm a
carpenter i'm i'm a weed whacker person
i don't i don't know jobs um but
uh and then you've got different avatars
that like myers-briggs starts to come
into with like self-discovery in terms
of like business and like how do i
how do i become a person that sells
things and how do i connect with
customers and things like that and then
there's archetype work eventually where
you're starting to understand like what
are these inner energies within myself
right and i feel like
when i talked about you know the toddler
right and this toddler feeling this
tension or release
that doesn't go away anytime we're
developing as a person everything that
we've taken from childhood
is still within us in some sense it's a
matter of whether we use it repress it
or
uh integrate it right and i feel like
in a lot of ways
what denzel was talking about with
reactions like these chain reactions
essentially this massive rippling effect
is that we are
we're doing it to ourselves
all the time it's just the natural part
of being human is that we're
we're causing our own chaos constantly
um
by reacting and being uncomfortable
all the time like
i imagine that there are people laying
in bed by themselves not looking at
their phone and they're thinking about
like oh the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] patriarchy
and it's like you're in bed by yourself
why is that
why is that torturing you it doesn't
need to torture you right now right
like
you are not the aggregor you are not the
wave of what's happening there's a
separation that i think is healthy that
kind of needs to happen
it's sovereignty it's your free movement
and so one of the reasons that i do get
still kind of frustrated is that it it's
while it's helpful to keep
rooting out
the
you know the the middlemen who have been
abusing their power and
over sexualizing women and causing
problems and not hiring
minorities
not
you know doing all sorts of unconscious
practices to keep their social standing
up
uh
there's still this sense that
the the
i i call it i refer to it as
pointing a finger at the moon the moon
explodes and you're like i did that
right where there are so many different
circumstances that have been causing the
removal of these men that have been
allowing black lives to start i mean
like
i don't in the last few years which is
amazing i've we've been seeing
more
professional avatars of what black lives
look like on tv
like you see it in commercials all the
time there may be just a few archetypes
and that still needs to expand but you
know you get kind of like the
light-skinned woman with the curly hair
and you know there's
there's that
avatar there's there's some avatar
starting to form that becomes socially
acceptable and i think part of this
all of this is just like not
acknowledging that there has been and is
progress happening
because
not only that men are trash but there
are people saying everything is garbage
the world is a dumpster fire
everything's going to fall apart the
global warming
which are things that are serious and we
need to do to consider
but
the fact that the like everything's
incredible like you can lay in bed and
you could breathe
what
instead of just hopping on twitter and
finding all the tweets of how many men
have been raped how many women have been
raped and stuff like that like you are
attracting that that is happening and
that's so sad it's terrible i'm not
saying that it's that we should
disregard that but if that's all that
you're focusing on twitter has an
algorithm that's what it's going to
continue to feed you and it's going to
continue to give you this notion of just
how terrible the world is when you know
like yeah so yeah i'm right there with
you like gosh like
just laying in bed and just thinking so
much about this this is an issue it's
bad
but
there's also so much good
this the good should not cause you to
ignore the bad
and the bad should not like you know how
egregiously huge the bat is should not
make you be like well i'm just not going
to do anything
but
i think that there's an extreme that
both like
parties tend to take and yeah and
there's a reason i brought up
sovereignty because for me sovereignty
is how i define goodness
i think like goodness can become this
esoteric thing
that we don't really take the time to
define for ourselves
and
we're still deploying goodness based on
what the church tells us is good or what
uh you know the neighbor down the street
tells us is good or what our mom told us
is good or bad that going back to the
mother and father complex you know we're
operating our sense of self our sense of
ego our sense of
of what we need to save what we need to
do what we need to accomplish based on
often
for a long time that needs to happen an
external sense of what good is an else
defined sense of goodness
but at some point
there's got to be this like
question of like do i believe that
is that is that true is that
what good is is is
is that enabling movement or am i just
trying to stop everything from happening
so i can actually eat my cereal in peace
you know this is all kind of
to me coming to a head with
the thought that like we're just not
holding a lot of we're not coming out
this issue with a lot of
patience and endurance and i think
that's a really big just problem of our
time like
because that example of someone lying in
bed at night being like ah the
patriarchy
i had a night like that last night where
i was just i had an interaction with a
man and i
like we were frustrated with each other
this is like just an acquaintance who
like
i know through a program we're both
doing and
i was like well really like this is the
patriarchy like it's like this man has
just been conditioned to think this and
now like he's always going to be out
saying things like this and i'm like
i have not stuck long enough with this
interaction with this man to know that
any of that is the case and i imagine
that if he's frustrated there's
something that i'm totally missing that
it would be important for me to know
about
where this like lack of seeing each
other's perspectives is coming from but
it's so easy
to just dissociate from these like
difficult conversations and go okay
there's this whole narrative i can latch
on to about how like
men don't care about women's feelings
and i feel like men can have the exact
same narrative like oh women just want
to like be manipulative or whatever and
the problem is that
we don't stay with these conversations
and we don't actually like work these
issues out very often and actually get
to an understanding
there's like this expectation on
everyone to already be perfect so
instead of like like if denzel you say
something that pisses me off like
instead of going okay let's talk that
out it's so easy to go like ah just
another like man who doesn't care to
understand women we can go you know
yeah
and that's a i think a really big
problem of our time not just with this
issue but with like
literally every issue
yes i think the patriarchy as a term
unfortunately has become
the equivalent of saying it was the
devil
in its esotericness
yeah like
for me it feels like the equivalent of
maybe i've experienced
this is a weird example but i'm just
doing it for comedy um
but like i look at jupiter and i'm like
it's made of gravy and like ah i don't
like gravy i don't want to see jupiter
ever again and then just like starting
to create all of this internal chaos
because of my relationship to
an experience that i had with gravy
which is not the experience of jupiter
like
that's a weird example but
yeah it's like when there's an
expectation that isn't perfectly met
instead of like
grounding oneself and like okay well
what is happening like what is this
experience that's taking place it's so
easy to use like the divisiveness of
everything online to just decide it
should have been this way
yes
so let's let's rage about that instead
of like what actually is and finding
common ground there
and i imagine
yeah a lot of that comes down to
that
so i i want to offer something that i
think could be helpful for at least like
whoever's watching can be from whatever
different perspective that you have but
i feel like there are a couple things to
consider when you're like
like we're talking about this concept of
of like the patriarchy or some esoteric
finger pointing like there's
and also there's like an automaticity to
that right like we're reciting things
that are
where it's almost like we're tapping
into the agrigore and it's like putting
on the agri-gore masking or like the
patriarchy
it's like we're hiding
how we really feel on a nuanced detailed
level
in favor of putting on the
aggregate the agrigore's face right
we're taking on that persona
and living with that persona privately
in our own home
instead of really getting to know
how i really feel about
this particular person
it or this particular situation or these
people that i've interacted with or my
relationship with my father or
etc
um and and
you know not allowing for
ourselves to play the game of life at
all right so like there's this concept
of in in growing uh in personal
development
there's grow up wake up open up clean up
and show up
it's a very ken wilbur thing but
like growing up i mentioned like making
mistakes like it's just the idea that
teenagers are teenagers like our brains
don't fully develop until we're 25 years
old right
um and and to quickly reference like the
whole devil and sort of religionizing of
it all too is like
um
dario nardi
he does a lot of brain scan work with
personalities and stuff like that he
pointed out that the same part of the
brain activates in
fundamentalist devout religious people
as they do in secular atheist people who
are really intensely
passionate about something and that's
kind of what i mean with that
automaticity there's like something that
just clicks online it's almost like a
defense mechanism it's just like a
well you
you just start almost like pulling from
a well of something that isn't really
you it's just like like a vault that you
opened up and you just pulled out the
shotgun you're just like
right
and so when i talk about
waking up being the second one
waking up being this like
being aware of that automatic-ness
being aware that like is this how i
really feel is this what i really think
goodness is is this like am i just
reciting something do i really feel this
way
um
and kind of just being aware having a
relationship starting to have a
relationship with yourself not just in
an automatic personality sense but in
having a conversation with yourself kind
of sense
and then there's opening up about that
processing it going to a therapist
writing in a journal
scribbling my partner molly has this
really great practice uh called ugly art
and we do it every mo every month at our
studio space
put on some music grab a sharpie
scribble
and then just like cover over that it's
it's a perfectionism process of letting
go of perfectionism but it's also just a
raw
expression it's just like
you're letting yourself flow my book is
kind of about that my book is is
sort of putting down the persona shield
and letting my ego talk
in a sense and the multiple aspects of
my ego talk because we have a lot of
things going on inside right and then
the cleaning up is that shadow work i
was talking about like looking through
the bag that you've been dragging behind
you
and then showing up is
kind of what i talked about with
sovereignty now i know what my
principles are and so i'm showing up
here with you heidi and you denzel and
we're talking about this stuff
i've got a lifelong
history of making mistakes of figuring
stuff out
of whatever and we're all doing it
on our own individual channels sharing
our individual stories
sharing our processes you know trying to
grow from and with each other
and uh you know i think that's all part
of a healthy process of of personal
development so that's what i got in
terms of
you know some growth things to to
consider
yeah i feel like
there's been so much in this and so many
things that could be jumping points for
so many other conversations i know right
but i want to just like thank you guys
both and i also want to just circle
around and see if like there's anything
else
that either of you feel like we've
missed or that like it's important to
touch on before we start wrapping up but
um
well actually let's start with that like
denzel i want to popcorn down to you as
well like
is there anything that you feel like
you wanted to have a discussion about or
that's come up that we haven't touched
on or covered over the last couple hours
no i actually hit all my bullet points
[Laughter]
this is i consider that a success
because like i didn't have any bullet
points but if somebody had bullet points
and we did it
yeah i think it's like this this whole
conversation for me raised a bigger
question of just what does it look like
to having a society that accepts and
integrates
or that accepts the integration of
masculine and feminine energy in
everybody of any
gender identity
and how would that be different and i
imagine that's a very fun thought to
think to sit with
and i appreciate both of you for
like sharing all of your perspectives i
know this is like a
touchy subject in a lot of ways and
anytime it gets brought up like people
have lots of opinions lots of thoughts
and that that's great too like that's
something we can all learn from and and
i just appreciate both of your
willingness to be
like present with this topic and follow
the conversation wherever it leads and
it's always awesome speaking to both you
you guys are like just two of my
favorite people to hear the perspectives
of so it's been awesome thank you so
much
for even being a woman
that
facilitated such a conversation and to
listen to us
um and despite some of the things that
we might have said
that might be like oh i just i just
always have admired and loved how much i
think i literally
again like posted about this like
i see the way that you handle things on
twitter and how you're constantly being
like hmm
i'm sorry i don't think i understand
where you're coming from here can you
elaborate a little bit more instead of
being like what you know and i
love that so much because
as someone who
i really feel like i'm never like
99.99 of the time i'm not trying to
offend or hurt anyone
when someone just jumps into assuming
like oh you're just it's like well no i
word things badly sometimes sorry but
if i noticed that like oh it actually
like seemed like i was attacking you
i will be happy to elaborate like no
this is not how i meant it so thank you
for actually being that type of person
who's like
this is hit me a little bit wrong but
i'm going to assume that you're not
intending to hit me wrong so can you
please elaborate here more of like what
exactly you meant instead of just being
someone who just reacts
and yeah i appreciate you just yeah
creating this conversation i'm looking
forward to the comments that will be
left hopefully you know it'll continue
to broaden my perspective as it already
has been throughout this conversation
yeah
sorry i was just gonna say i appreciate
you saying that because i also imagine
that's a process for me like that that's
a process of like learning to
not be as reactive and to assume like is
there something i'm missing here and i
think that this whole conversation
hopefully is like an example of that
as a woman who does sometimes just get
frustrated with like
men and the patriarchy and i'm sure it
happens in both directions like i think
it's so important for both like any time
we're frustrated with any group of
people to just be like well what's
what's getting missed and i hope that
that's just like a bigger conversation
we keep having
and yeah sorry christian i interrupted
no i was just gonna say i said the same
i appreciate you very much and there's
like
if there's a mantra that i go by these
days it's uh don't preach growth remove
the factors limiting growth
and i think that often requires a lot of
just demonstrating and
talking and having conversations like i
don't expect everyone to watch this and
change because they watch this there are
plenty of people who aren't ready to
have this conversation there are bloody
people who maybe will start hearing me
talk in the first few minutes and make
an assumption about
you know where i'm coming from or where
denzel's coming from where heidi's
coming from or you know like that's just
going to happen yeah it's just like part
of the process and i think uh
accepting all of that is is
just what we're all here to
to to keep doing it's a hot wonderful
delightful mess and i appreciate being a
part of it with you guys
that is a beautiful closing statement
could not have come up with anything
better than that
uh
so i'm going to put links to these guys
channels and
websites and just places where you can
go find them online in the comments
section of this video it's been awesome
talking to you guys as always um and
just really appreciate yeah the time
that we spent on this topic
