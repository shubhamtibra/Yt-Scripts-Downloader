hey guys heidi preeve here i made my own
set today so that's the first thing i
want to acknowledge
i got this tree from my living room and
i moved it next to this poster that i
found in my den
and i thought it looked pretty cool and
then i sat in between the two which
doesn't seem like a big deal
but normally anytime i have a set that
looks halfway decent it's because sarah
made it because i have no
eyes i kind of self-identify as like a
discombobulated brain that has no
connection to the outside world but
today
i put two things together and i'm very
proud of myself so if you want to like
throw some compliments in the comments i
don't mind at all anyways if you're here
to actually learn
things you are hopefully in luck this is
my fifth time recording this video
but i will record it five more times and
i will record it five more times after
that because this topic
is so important and i think that it is
so
misunderstood misconstrued uh mislabeled
mistyped all of the misses
in the typology community apply to this
system and this system
is attachment style so attachment style
vaguely refers to how we relate to
ourselves and then how we relate to
other people
in intimate relationships so that mostly
means partnership relationships but it
can also mean friendships it can mean
parental relationships it can mean
any authority figure relationship you
have is usually like a relationship that
triggers your attachment wounds
so we're going to go over most
specifically what attachment styles look
like in romantic relationships because
that's where you'll see them come out
the most strongly so attachment styles
are the system that started when did
attachment style start let me look that
up
i don't always know as much as i think i
know cool so testimonial style started
off in the 50s and 60s when it was
getting really popular in psychology to
blame everything on your parents so the
two psychologists that are kind of at
the helm of this theory are john bolby
and mary ainsworth
so they created this situation called
the strange situation where they
basically put a baby in a room had the
parent leave the room
and then they put a stranger in the room
and they watched how the baby interacted
with the stranger and also how the baby
interacted with the parent both when the
parent left and when the parent came
back
and then they categorized the responses
of the child into four different
response patterns
so those four different response
patterns usually correlate to your adult
attachment style so you'll have one
style when you're an infant and one
style when you're an adult they usually
correlate to one another
not always there can be like extreme
trauma situations that happen over the
course of your life that change your
attachment style but for the most part
by the age of two if you didn't form a
secure attachment you're gonna have some
problems later in life and we're gonna
talk about those problems
today now it's actually really common to
have an insecure attachment style so
insecure refers to any attachment style
that is not kind of
healthy and adaptive so the four
attachment styles are called secure
that means like you're fine you probably
don't need to be watching this video
anxious avoidant and fearful avoidant
fearful avoidance is also called anxious
avoidance sometimes but because we're
already using those words in this video
i don't want to over complicate things
too much
so we're gonna call the anxious avoiding
the fearful avoidant and those terms are
pretty much interchangeable anyways
so most of the reason i'm making this
video is because i see so many people
placing themselves in the wrong category
in this system so for example fearful
avoidance is kind of the infj of
attachment theory everyone thinks it
applies to them because they're not very
clear on what anxious and avoidant
themselves are so a lot of people are
actually in the anxious or avoidant
category but they place themselves in
the fearful avoidant category
so anxious and avoidant people make up
approximately 40
of the population together so about 20
each give or take a few percentage
points depending on which study you're
looking at
securely attached people make up
approximately 60 again give or take a
few percentage points
and then fearful avoidance people are
generally i think about two percent of
the population so it's a much smaller
population
but they do probably need more help in
the attachment theory space because they
are the most up
so to speak but we'll get to that as we
go on another important thing to know
about attachment theory your attachment
style
can change so it's not like myers-briggs
are the enneagram where you kind of come
into the world you have this type and
that's the one you get your entire life
your attachment style is something that
you can actively work on healing
and growing through and changing so if
you are insecurely attached meaning if
you're anxious
avoidant or fearful avoidant you can
through a lot of
really intensive self-work change your
style but it's unlikely that that's
going to happen accidentally because it
does
take an incredible amount of
deconstructing your worldview it shows
up in a lot of
super subtle ways to the point where
it's actually very hard to identify your
own attachment style it's usually best
to go to a practitioner
because attachment styles are inherently
self-deceptive and i'm going to talk
more about that as we get into all the
different styles but yeah first let's
backtrack a bit let's talk about what
these styles are
the first style i'm going to talk about
is anxious so again somewhere around 20
of the population falls into this
category and anxiously attached people
are people who learned really young
that they have to over assert their
needs in order to get them met
so this can happen for a variety of
reasons it can happen because a
caregiver is unresponsive for some
reason so maybe they're ill maybe
they're mentally ill maybe they're a
single parent who's just over taxed and
they have three kids to take care of and
they're also trying to pay all the bills
and so they don't have a lot of focused
time and attention to give their baby
so the baby learns i have to try out a
whole different
range of strategies to get my parents
attention so there's a video online
called the still face experiment where
they basically have a parent not respond
to the baby
and not give it any sort of mirroring so
the baby will first cry to try to get
his parents attention because that's
what babies are used to
and then it'll maybe try to make the mom
laugh or like make a joke or do a funny
noise that the mom usually laughs at and
then if that doesn't work it'll start
throwing things and throwing a tantrum
and these are all strategies that the
baby is using to try to get its needs
met because when you're a baby
you don't have a whole lot of strategies
for getting someone to pay attention to
you you don't know how to communicate
your needs assertively
you only know how to kind of cry and
throw a fit or try like some warm
strategies and some strategic ways to
get your needs met
so this attachment style the anxiously
attached style
is from babies who were not attended to
immediately when they were children they
had to try a whole range of things to
get their needs met so as adults
they have this giant buffet of
strategies they use to get partners to
pay attention to them because they still
have this kind of core inherent belief
that i need to over assert my needs in
order to get them met no one is going to
come and take care of me unless i'm
constantly making sure that i'm setting
myself
up for a position where my needs are
going to be looked after so the view
that the anxiously attached person has
of the world
is that i am not okay you are okay so
they have a negative view of self
positive view of others and where that
comes from is when they were a baby they
really didn't know how to meet their own
needs babies can't do that babies are
dependent creatures by nature right
so they saw the caregiver as someone who
was able to come give them what they
needed
when they were around and when they were
present but they really internalized
that lesson if i can't do it by myself i
can't meet my own needs
so anxiously attach people as adults
still kind of feel that way they feel
like something's kind of wrong or flawed
with me
i don't necessarily know how to take
care of my own emotional needs they
don't know how to self-soothe
they only know how to co-regulate so
co-regulating is when we kind of borrow
someone else's strategy for making
ourselves
feel okay so anytime you go to a friend
you're having a bad day and you vent to
your friend and your friend makes some
jokes and you have a laugh you're
co-regulating so it's using someone
else's energy
to kind of make your own nervous system
calm down anxiously attached people
overdo this so they're constantly
looking for someone else to come help
soothe their emotional state
because as children they didn't learn to
self-soothe so the anxious person tends
to have a lot of trouble being alone
they don't like to be single if they
don't have to be for long periods of
time they tend to really want to get
into relationships
and once they get into those
relationships they want to move really
quickly through them and kind of hit all
of these milestones and lock it down
right away
so that they can have a sense of safety
and security feeling like okay
my needs are going to be met by this
other person because the law requires
them to because we're married and that's
of course not how it actually works
but in the brain of the anxiously
attached person that is how it works
they're always trying to get to this
place where they're finally securing
someone who will meet their needs
now anxiously attached people from what
i've seen mistyped most frequently as
fearful avoidant and the reason they do
that is because they have all of these
things called protest behaviors
so protest behaviors are things you do
to try to get your partner to pay
attention to you
so anxious people just like the baby in
the still face experiment will try a
whole range of strategies to get their
needs met
and if playing nice doesn't work so
normally their first kind of mode of
defense is
okay i'll go be nice i'll go do things
for my partner and then hope it's
reciprocated
but if that doesn't work they'll move to
things like starting a fight because at
least if a fight is started
they're getting that attention they need
they have this deep desire for someone
else to notice that they exist and pay
attention to them and give them focused
attention
and when someone's fighting with you
they're giving you a lot of focused
attention it's not
a good strategy for getting your needs
met but it is a strategy
so other things they'll do they will
threaten to leave they will tell their
partner i'm going to leave you if you
don't do this
or they'll storm out but if you're doing
any of that stuff with the goal of your
partner paying more attention to you
maybe you want them to storm after you
and go no
no don't leave wait i love you that is a
protest behavior it's not
an avoidant behavior so a lot of anxious
people don't properly understand what
avoidant behaviors are so when they hear
about them they're like oh yeah i do
that
i start fights i threaten to leave but
they do that because they want their
partner to come
closer not because they genuinely want
to leave so anxious people have a lot of
different protest behaviors and it's the
exact equivalent of a two-year-old
throwing a tantrum
so when a two-year-old throws a tantrum
they don't want people to go away
they want people to come closer and give
them what they need and that's the same
thing that anxious people are doing when
they're doing protest behaviors they
want their partners to come and soothe
them
so again anxious people have a negative
view of self positive view of others
so they believe similar to how they saw
their caregiver as someone who had it
all figured out and they didn't know how
to take care of themselves
they are now on the hunt for people who
have it all figured out so they can be
taken care of and this is unconscious
they don't know that they're doing this
but they're always kind of on the hunt
for people who seem very self-sufficient
and very independent
because they want those people to lend
them some of their resources
so when an anxious person gets
approached by another anxious person
they often feel very turned off they're
like oh get out of here i need someone
who can take care of themselves
so they can also take care of me and
that's why anxious people
often end up with dismissive avoidant
people so
avoidant people learned very early on in
child below the age of two just like the
anxious person did
that they were okay but the people
around them were not so what
often happens with the avoidant person
is that you'll see cases of their
parents
being unable to emotionally regulate
themselves the avoidant child learns
that they're actually better off taking
care of their emotional needs themselves
so very young below the age of two
avoiding children learn to self-soothe
so they learn strategies for calming
themselves down when they're upset
for not needing to co-regulate with the
parent because the parent is not a
reliable source of co-regulation for the
avoiding child
and to take care of their own needs as
much as humanly possible
so the avoidant person actually feels
like i'm okay
you are not okay and again that's a
world view that comes very early from
them because often they had parents who
truly were not okay
so they may have had a parent with some
sort of mental illness or some sort of
attachment style themselves that made
them project onto the child and need
things from the child she'll often see
this kind of reverse dynamic in the
childhood of avoidant children
where they had a very emotionally
immature parent who kind of needed
something from that child and the
avoidant child learns very early on i
have to set very strong boundaries
around myself because my parent is not
going to treat me with the appropriate
boundaries that a child parent
relationship should have
and again that happens very
unconsciously so this isn't something
that the avoidant person is actively
thinking
on the flip side avoidance are actually
the most likely type to mistake
themselves as secure
so avoidance learn to deal with the fact
that their environment is unsafe
through the process of denial and
emotional repression so they're very
quick to kind of go everything's good
everything's okay this isn't happening
they're kind of gaslighting themselves
accidentally
and then as an adult they'll often look
back on their childhood and go my
childhood was great nothing went wrong
everything was sunny and rosy
and then the more you dig and dig and
dig with the avoidant person you learn
everything was not sunshine and roses
they just
really repressed a lot of stuff or they
had a complete neglect of their inner
world as a child which they didn't know
was a problem they thought oh parents
don't really take an interest in their
child's inner world and the thoughts and
ideas and feelings that they're having
but it is normal for parents to do that
for children but the avoiding person
often doesn't realize that so they
mistype themselves as secure and believe
oh i have no problems in relationships
when really what they're doing is
avoiding intimacy like the plague
unconsciously
so avoidant people again have this world
view of i'm okay you're not okay so they
tend to have this inherent belief that
they're gonna be smothered in
relationships that people are gonna try
to take their resources that people are
going to ask and ask and ask for them
and that every time they give an inch a
mile is going to be taken and again
this formed very early on for them
because that was probably their reality
in some capacity in their family dynamic
so avoidant people tend to move very
slowly into romantic relationships kind
of the opposite of the anxious whereas
the anxious is kind of going into
relationships on fast forward
the avoidance is going on slow motion so
they hit the same milestones very slowly
they're slow to commit they might feel
freaked out by commitment
they're afraid that someone is going to
demand too much of them and then they're
not going to have enough left to
self-suit because again
the avoidant has a plethora of
self-soothing strategies
so just like the anxious person has
protest behaviors which we also call
activation strategies to get their needs
met the avoidant person has deactivating
strategies and what that means is that
they have strategies
for removing themselves emotionally from
a relationship and making sure that
they're okay so avoiding people will
often have a lot of what we call
creature comforts
and a lot of this language i'm borrowing
from the personal development school run
by tais gibson
which is my absolute favorite resource
for attachment style i will rave about
it
for like 10 straight minutes at the end
of this video so just hold on if you're
looking for that resource but that's
where a lot of this language is coming
from just to give credit where credit is
due so deactivating strategies for the
fearful avoidant might look like oh
escaping into like reading or video
games or some people will abuse drugs or
alcohol or food or whatever it is to
feel comforted
in a way that doesn't require them going
to another human being and co-regulating
so it's not just that avoidance are
resisting that it's that they don't
actually know it's an option so
avoidance never learned about
co-regulation because their parents
weren't able to do it for them properly
so they really do deeply at their core
feel like any problem that comes my way
i have to solve myself but they're not
really comfortable with asking for
things or asking other people for help
because they never learned that that was
really an
option that would work out when they
tried it so the avoidant person tends to
inherently have a positive view of self
and negative view of others so they see
themselves as capable resourceful able
to self-sooth and take care of
themselves
and they see other people as kind of
need machines what's really interesting
is there's a study that i think was
either in the book
attached or the attachment effect i
forget which book it was in they talked
about this experiment where they hooked
someone up to this machine where they
were going to intermittently shock them
so it was like a very high stress
situation and when the anxious person
had another person in the room with them
holding their hands
their stress levels went down so when
they were faced with a high stress
situation
anxious people feel more comfortable
when someone else is present helping
them co-regulate
but avoidant people felt more stressed
out when there was someone in the room
than they did when they were alone
because the avoidant person goes okay
i'm gonna now have to take care of my
own needs
and try to regulate yours whereas the
anxious person thinks oh thank god
someone else is here they can regulate
me so
these types end up dating each other a
lot and the reason they end up dating
each other
is a because they're both insecurely
attached so they're kind of the ones who
are constantly on the market
and b because their world views
perfectly align
now they don't align in a healthy way
they often play out in this really
unhealthy toxic dynamic that i'm gonna
talk a lot a lot more about in future
videos but they do
correspond with each other nicely
because the avoidant person believes i'm
okay but other people are gonna try to
take from me
and the anxious person believes i'm not
okay i need someone who can give me some
co-regulation
and when they meet each other those
world views are perfectly mirrored but
on the flip side when an anxious or an
avoidant type meets a securely attached
type it feels kind of weird and
uncomfortable
because they always feel like they're
waiting for the other shoe to drop like
the avoidant person is always like oh
when are you going to start
needing and needing and needing for me
and the anxious person feels like oh
when are you going to start drawing away
from me
it's this kind of strange thing where
they don't know what to make of the
secure person the secure person
generally doesn't want anything to do
with avoidant or anxious people because
they're instinctively looking for
someone who has a very centered and calm
and rational approach to relationships
since they do whereas the avoidant
person and the anxious person
are both operating from a place of
neurotic energy and that neurotic energy
creates this never-ending dynamic of
push-pull push-pull that you'll often
see in anxious avoidant relationships
but we'll talk
a lot more about what that looks like in
a future video because when it comes to
romantic relationships we are not
seeking what's healthiest we're seeking
what's most familiar
so if it so happens that a healthy
dynamic is what's familiar you're going
to seek out healthy partners but if
you're used to a dynamic where you
always have to either
over assert your boundaries or over
assert your needs you're going to seek
out a continuation of that dynamic as an
adult until you heal your attachment
style
and again later on we'll get into what
healing looks like so the third
attachment style is one that kind of
sits in the middle of the spectrum so
the secure attachment style has the best
of both worlds
so where the avoidant person is really
good at self-regulating and taking care
of themselves and the anxious person is
good at stating their needs and
co-regulating
the secure person knows how to do both
of those things so the secure person
feels like i'm okay
you're okay so they have a very healthy
sense of self they know how to take care
of themselves
they know how to self regulate and
self-soothe they have all of the
positive traits of the avoidant
and they also know how to initiate
intimate relationships they know how to
feel comfortable being close to someone
they know how and when to co-regulate
now securely attached people are
ironically
most likely to mistype themselves as
insecurely attached and the reason for
that is because securely attached people
grew up in generally safe environments
so generally as children they had their
physical needs met they had their
emotional needs met
and as such their nervous systems could
relax and when your nervous systems are
relaxed
you're able to look critically at your
parents so whereas someone like the
avoidant person has to almost
pretend that everything's perfect and
that their parents never did anything
wrong because
they aren't safe enough to recognize the
ways in which they're unsafe
the secure person is safe enough to
safely criticize their parents and know
my parent isn't going to leave me or
freak out if i'm a little bit critical
about the way that they're parenting
so the secure person will often think
that they're insecurely attached because
they're safe enough
to be critical of their parenting which
is very interesting so the securely
attached person has a positive view of
self
positive view of others so they tend to
be very comfortable both single
and in relationships so they don't have
this intense fear of either
getting into relationships like the
avoidantly attached people do or being
alone like the anxiously attached people
do
they're like yeah when i'm alone that's
cool that's fine i like my own company
and if i meet someone great who i get
along with and can build a healthy
relationship with then that's also great
so the securely attached person doesn't
feel
an inherent sense of distress with
either being alone or being in a
relationship
now the securely attached person will
feel situationally appropriate to stress
in either direction
so if a securely attached person is
being smothered by let's say a really
anxious person they will naturally feel
a bit avoidant because they'll recognize
oh this person isn't okay that doesn't
fit my world view of i'm okay you're
okay so i'm gonna go out and seek
someone who seems okay
and on the flip side if they're trying
to date an avoidant person they're like
oh this person's kind of projecting this
thing onto me where
it seems like they think that i'm not
okay but i am okay
so i'm gonna go out and seek someone who
wants to engage with me with a healthy
interdependent dynamic so the secure
person has both anxious and avoidant
tendencies
and they can also feel genuinely anxious
in a situation where let's say their
partner is cheating on them and it's
becoming very evident
so if it's normal to feel either anxiety
or avoidance in a situation the secure
person
will feel that so a lot of the time
secure people will actually mistype as
fearful avoidant because they're like oh
i do a mix of these two strategies
you will when it's appropriate if you're
secure but what you won't do if you're
secure
is be really avoidant in a situation
where it makes no sense to be avoidant
or you won't be really anxious in a
situation where there's absolutely no
reason for you to feel anxious
so the secure person in relationship
with another secure person is not going
to have a landmine of irrational
emotional triggers that kind of come out
of nowhere the same way you'll see for
any of the insecurely attached types and
the secure person tends to be pretty
good at assertive communication so
they're pretty good at stating their
needs knowing what their needs are
understanding what's mine to deal with
versus what should i bring to my partner
and ask us to put on the table and deal
with together
so the secure person tends to have a
natural understanding
of when they should self-soothe versus
when they need their partner's help
because something's a relationship issue
not just a them
issue and with all the other types we'll
see a lot of confusion in these areas so
the anxious person tends to think
everything is a relationship
issue the avoidant person tends to think
nothing is a relationship issue and they
should be able to fix
it all on their own and then the fearful
avoidant is a whole other bag of tricks
that we're going to get to in a minute
but the securely attached person is
really good at kind of understanding
this is yours this is mine they just
kind of naturally know here's where i
end and you begin and here's where we
confuse our lives and here's where we
have to be our own independent people
and they're able to maintain a very
healthy sense of both independence and
interdependence in a relationship so
secure people in a relationship do not
lose their sense of self which to some
degree you do see for all of the other
insecurely attached styles but secure
people when they enter into a
partnership they feel like i'm still
just as me as i've ever been
but now i'm me alongside this other
person who's also themselves and that's
a great thing
so secure attachment is what we're all
aiming for if you want to do
any work with attachment style it's
generally to try to get yourself to the
place where you're relating to other
people like a secure person would relate
to other people and that's something
we're going to talk
a lot more about in other videos how to
heal your attachment style and work
towards secure attachment
but before we get there we're going to
talk about the last attachment style
which is fearful avoidant
now fearful avoidant is another
attachment style that sits right in the
middle of that spectrum so we have
anxious over here avoiding over here
fearful avoidance
in the middle so while the securely
attached person borrows the positive
traits from both anxious and avoidant
the fearful avoidant type borrows the
negative traits from both anxious and
avoidant
so the fearful avoidant person has a
negative view of self
negative view of others so with
anxiously attached people we tend to see
them not liking themselves very much but
idealizing other people
with the avoidant person we tend to see
them really liking themselves and having
a high self-respect but then finding a
lot of fault in other people with a
securely attached person we see them
liking themselves and liking others a
normal amount and with a fearful
avoidant person
there's a very strong sense of judgment
towards the self so having those anxious
feelings of i'm not worthy of love i
have to kind of trick someone into
loving me i'm going to have to over
assert my needs if i ever want to get
them met
but then also having that negative
avoidant view of
other people are not trustworthy other
people are not okay other people are
going to try to take from me
and when you have all of that going on
internally it is a giant landmine of
triggers and so being a fearful avoidant
type
is kind of the trickiest attachment
style to navigate because you don't
really
have a solid leg to stand on in either
direction so very early on in childhood
the fearful avoidance learned that there
was no
organized strategy for getting their
needs met so what does that mean
both the anxious and the avoidant type
have organized strategies
so the anxious person knows i might have
to assert my needs five different times
in five different ways
but my needs will eventually get met by
this person they believe that their
parent is capable of meeting their needs
the avoidant person believes as long as
i construct my boundaries around myself
i will be okay my parent will not ever
be capable of meeting my needs the way
that i need them met
so both of those are organized
strategies and what that means is that
they don't have healthy views of
relationships but they do have
consistent views of them
the fearful avoidant person learned that
sometimes their parents will meet their
needs
sometimes they won't sometimes they can
go to their parent for warmth sometimes
their parent will be a very scary figure
to them so they have a disorganized
strategy
they don't know when it's safe to move
closer in intimate relationships and
when it's safe to move away
so they use both activating and
deactivating strategies so they'll use
protest behavior sometimes
and other times they'll use withdrawing
strategies where they go put a bunch of
boundaries around themselves and push
their partners out
so the fearful avoidance type is very
confusing even to the fearful avoidant
themselves
whereas the anxious type is always kind
of gunning towards this goal of gaining
more and more relationship security
and it does feel like an endless goal
where it's kind of like going down this
well there's always another trapdoor in
another trap door where you never feel
secure enough
and the avoidant person is always kind
of looking to arrive at a place where
they feel completely self-sufficient and
independent and like they don't need
anybody
the fearful avoidance doesn't really
know which direction to move in
so they're going to go towards a
relationship and then all of a sudden be
like wait a minute
this is not what i want and pull away
and leave the relationship and then
they're going to go towards another
relationship
it's a very kind of disoriented type so
they have a mix of both protests or
activating strategies and deactivating
strategies
so a lot of the time what we see with
the fearful avoidant is they come on
very strong
and they want a lot of attention and
warmth and closeness kind of like the
anxious style right away
so they'll kind of love bomb their
partner and then as soon as it's
commitment time or when their partner
starts implying a commitment is on the
horizon
all of a sudden their avoidance
strategies are activated and they want
to set really firm boundaries around
themselves
or quite often they'll leave the
relationship because they don't
understand you can have boundaries
within a relationship they think you
have to either be
100 in or 100 out so you'll often see
fearful avoidance rushing into a
relationship and then all of a sudden
leaving the relationship and wanting
nothing to do with it and it's really
important to note that this is happening
in situations where it's not appropriate
so it's not like the securely attached
person where they feel anxious when they
have a reason to be anxious and avoidant
when they have a reason to be avoided
the fearful avoidant
feels avoidant when everything's going
well so when the relationship is happy
and relaxed and things are good so maybe
you're in the honeymoon period maybe
you're just beyond the honeymoon period
and you're starting to relax into a
routine
the fearful avoidance goes wait a minute
if life is a minefield and one has not
gone off in a while it means one's about
to go off and they start freaking out
and that's often
when they exit the relationship but then
as soon as they've exited the pressure
is off and all of a sudden they're like
oh wait a minute
now i feel okay so maybe i should go
back to it because they do have a bit of
that idealization piece that the
anxiously attached person has
so what you'll very often see with
fearful avoidance is that they'll be
in relationship but with an exit
strategy because they feel safe
as long as they know this isn't going to
last forever so where's the avoidant
type we'll kind of avoid relationships
or find ways to just create a lot of
space around themselves and create
really firm boundaries within their
relationship
the fearful avoidance you'll often see
getting into a relationship
and getting completely enmeshed and
codependent and intertwined with the
person that they're with
but then also have this really iron-clad
exit strategy in their mind so in their
heads they're going okay
i'm going to do this and i'm going to
give up all of my own wants and needs
but in six months i'm getting out of
here
and that's really the key difference
between the anxious and the avoidant the
anxious type really does tend to want
long-term security so they really are
generally gunning towards like marriage
and security long-term
the fearful avoidance is always kind of
looking for an exit route or a reason to
leave the relationship
and this is not a protest behavior so
they're not feigning it they're not
pretending they want to leave so their
partner pays more attention to them and
convinces them to stay
they actually want an exit route and
they only feel comfortable generally in
relationships that they feel like are
not going to last
and that even to the fearful avoidant
type is very confusing so this type
tends to feel really disoriented even
about their own behavior
they might have a lot of self-judgments
about why can't i just be happy and love
why can't i just have this relationship
and let it be
why do i always have to want out as soon
as things get good and that is a really
confusing thing and the more you learn
about attachment style the more you
learn that there are specific reasons
why your brain is orienting itself this
way
and specific reasons why you're having
all these seemingly irrational thoughts
it all does make sense eventually but
you have to do the work of figuring out
what happened early on or what
strategies or world views you formed
that you're now going to have to
dismantle deconstruct and do some work
around rearranging
before you can get to that secure place
but hope is
absolutely possible for every single
attachment style anxious people can
learn to trust rely on and love
themselves
avoidant people can learn to trust and
rely on and have healthy interdependent
relationships with other people
and fearful avoidance can learn to both
trust and respect themselves and
self-soothe
and also trust and respect others and
rely on other people to give them what
they need so here's your fine go home
just kidding you can watch if you want
to figure out why everyone around you is
so neurotic i
really really cannot recommend enough
the personal development school
i'm not in any way affiliated with this
school aside from the fact that i pay
for all of their courses because i want
to do my own healing through them
um but tais gibson is the person who
runs the school and she's the first
person who have ever heard speak about
the avoidant spectrum type so fearful
avoidant and dismissive avoidant
as people who have deep rich inner
worlds and are not just villains so a
lot of the time when you look at
attachment literature online it's kind
of
very sympathetic towards the anxiously
attached types and then it's very very
unsympathetic towards the avoidantly
attached types and it just kind of goes
like oh avoid those people at all costs
don't date them they're only out for
themselves
and they're not really given the grace
of acknowledging that just like the
anxious attachment style avoidant
attachment styles
are a product of trauma and the
inability to trust other people and form
healthy relationships
is also a trauma response so if you're
looking to do
really really deep work on your
attachment style i highly recommend the
personal development school they also
have an
awesome youtube channel where taise
breaks down every attachment style and
every attachment style related behavior
but the courses are really good for
doing the work on those things
so while i also hope to be a good
resource at some point in the future for
attachment style and i would love to do
a lot of work with cross-referencing
personality type with attachment style
if you're looking right now to get
started on your journey with attachment
style that's 100 where i recommend
i am doing really deep really intensive
work on my own attachment style right
now so i'm on the avoidance spectrum
myself
um i use mostly deactivating strategies
in relationships so i'm somewhere
between the fearful avoidant and the
dismissive avoidant
and you will often see with the fearful
avoidance that they tend in one
direction or the other
but i just want to encourage you to
really learn about all of the styles
before placing yourselves in one of the
styles in the middle
because it is normal for some let's say
protest behaviors to look like avoidant
behaviors but they have a very different
motivation behind them so that's
something
we'll talk a lot more about in the
future but for now i just wanted to say
happy valentine's day regardless of what
your attachment style is

partner or yourself
