hey so i'm just popping on today to have
a little conversation with you guys
about fi users and the fantasies that we
get ourselves wrapped into
so if you use fi meaning if you are an
enfp infp
isfp or esfp and then to a lesser extent
all of the tj types but today i'm going
to focus on
enfps and infps you probably already
know what i'm talking about so you get
this kind of
alternate life that you're living in
your head where you have all these
things that you don't have in the real
world and then you can have this
struggle between um how much of that
fantasy you're able to bring into the
real world and how disappointed you get
when you aren't able to bring it all
into the real world sometimes because
those fantasies require other people's
participation
and those people don't know about the
fantasies because you never communicated
them
and this is probably one of the single
biggest problems that i see happening
for enfps 9 fps
and the reason i focus on enfp's 9 fps
here besides the fact that those are the
types i work with with the soul bootcamp
programs
is because we do have an se blind spot
that isfps and esfps don't have so esfps
and ifps
use extraverted sensing which means that
when they have a fantasy they're more
likely to go out into the world and try
to act on it and kind of make it happen
and then they got a lot of feedback
right so they kind of quickly figure out
like this is realistic this is not
realistic
i maybe want this person to feel this
way but i asked them how they feel and
they were like nah not like that
so they're kind of dealing in real time
with their fantasies whereas enfps and
infps being a step removed from reality
because extroverted intuition is not as
engaged
with its external environment as sc is
um
it's a little bit more speculative than
it is action oriented
we can often stew in the same fantasies
for years and not ever properly
either act on them or we
can act on them badly so basically we
can have this
very elaborate plan for how we want
things to go in our heads that we
don't really fact check we don't reality
test
we don't check in with other people and
be like hey are you cool with things
happening this way the way that i want
them to go in my head and then we get
very very disillusioned
when things don't go the way that we had
planned for them to go internally
and i think that that often creates this
dichotomy for nfps where we feel like we
have one of two options when we start
becoming aware of a fantasy that we have
so let's say you are um
starting to fantasize about a new person
so you're having this
life in your head where you're with this
new person and like kind of all your
problems are solved and
you know all of these things you used to
feel about yourself you don't feel
anymore because
this person and you are finally together
and you feel so validated and everything
in your life is going great
and we think that one of two things has
to happen which is either
we play out that fantasy in real life or
we discarded that fantasy realizing it's
not realistic but there's a third
option for fi users that i actually
think is very very important
useful and worth considering which is
take a look at that fantasy and without
even thinking about whether or not you
can make it
play out in real life and without even
thinking about how to let it go
just ask yourself what is this fantasy
trying to tell me
so what am i missing in my life that my
mind is trying to make me aware of
through this story
that it's telling me because all people
think in stories and there's a moral to
every single story right
every good story anyways and our mind is
no different like our mind is constantly
constructing stories because it's trying
to get us
to pay attention to some kind of moral
but often we
miss the subtlety as fi users and we
think okay this story is literal
so i literally have to go be with this
person or else nothing i'll never be
happy again
but it's very possible that your mind is
just telling you oh
this person has a trait that maybe you
feel
is vulnerable within yourself so maybe
someone is
super super confident and you just love
that about them
and so you're having this fantasy where
like oh a super confident person could
be really interested in me
and what would that mean about myself so
ask your mind if this story were true
what would be true about myself that is
not true about myself as i sit here
fantasizing about it
so if that person were to love me back
if that
job were to be mine if that trip that i
want to take i were finally on
which traits would i be acting out which
traits within me would be present
that i currently haven't taken the time
to cultivate within myself
because fantasies are kind of this very
easy way to avoid
actually working on ourselves because if
i can just dissociate into this fantasy
land where i already have the thing that
i want
then i don't have to do the work that it
takes to get me to the place where i
have that thing
tyce gibson who runs the personal
development school talks about our minds
being kind of like
gps's so you're always rooting yourself
to the quickest route possible to the
feeling that you want to have
so it doesn't matter if it's the
healthiest way of getting there it
doesn't matter it's the most sustainable
way of getting there
but if there's a very quick way to get
you to feel the way that you want to
feel your mind is always going to try to
take you there first
and for nfps it's always going to be
easiest to just
dissociate into a fantasy where we've
already done the work that we would have
to do in order to get to the place we
want to get to
because we get this kind of high off of
feeling like oh i'm already there i
already have this thing because i'm
imagining it and it feels so real
that it's kind of the same as getting
there um but
that doesn't discount the actual work of
traveling in that direction
doing the work gaining the skills to
feel confident in ourselves and to feel
like we're actually pursuing a path we
want to pursue in life
so instead of trying to either play out
or discard your fantasies as an fi user
try just looking at what is this fantasy
telling me about the self-work that i
need to do
so i have a lot of fantasies about um
getting a six-pack and like revealing my
six-pack and going to the beach and
everyone who's ever rejected me in any
form is there and they're
so jealous of me um what is that fantasy
telling me that fantasy is telling me
i have feelings of inadequacy in certain
areas it's telling me
maybe there's a sense of personal
discipline that i'm noticing i don't
have i don't have the discipline to do
100 crunches every day i never have
i've never cultivated that but maybe
it's time for me to start
becoming the kind of person who's a
little bit more disciplined because i'm
coveting that trait so heavily that i'm
fantasizing constantly about it
but if i were to take this fantasy and
go okay i will be happy once i have a
six-pack
i'm gonna get my six-pack and be very
very disillusioned when it didn't fix my
whole life
but if i tell myself i want to start
cultivating discipline
and i want to start working
strategically and consistently towards
the things that i want
that's a very achievable goal and that's
a means goal so
an n's goal is okay i want to arrive at
something but a means goal is i want to
develop a new way of getting to places
so i want to be a person who can infuse
discipline into the way that i approach
everything whether it's creative work
whether it's my physical health whether
it's my relationships
and when you have a means goal it's a
lot more applicable to a lot of
different areas of your life so it pays
off
over and over and over again as opposed
to an ends goal which maybe pays off in
this kind of like crazy high for 10
minutes and then all of a sudden you get
this sense of like oh i'm disillusioned
and i'm back to where i started i'm back
at square one and then you have to
identify a new end goal and then once
you get there you're disillusioned again
it's this kind of never-ending
repetitive cycle
we will stay stuck in that forever until
we realize that our fantasies are not
meant to be acted out in real life
they're meant to tell us something about
what's missing so that fantasy version
of yourself is telling you really
important and really meaningful things
it's communicating
such pivotal information
if you just take a minute and listen to
it and don't take it too literally
but just look at your fantasies as who
is this person i'm fantasizing about who
are you in the fantasy not who's this
other person that you're fantasizing
about like marrying
who are you in the fantasy what's
different where are the discrepancies
and what do you need to do in order to
start bridging those discrepancies
um making them smaller and smaller and
smaller until you're actually living as
the kind of person
that you would usually just fantasize
about don't discount
the power of those fantasies as fi users
because they are such
good indications of the work that you
are becoming ready to do
because you're working with what's real
and what's actually going on with you
and sfi users that is the pinnacle of
self-awareness
and it's the brilliance of this function
so let me know in the comments where
you're kind of at in this process of
fantasizing rejecting your fantasies
accepting them extracting the principles
from them i always used to think
you have to either reject or go for your
fantasies full force
but lately i'm learning that there's a
lot of wisdom in the middle ground and
i'm curious about where you guys are on
that journey so let me know below
and thank you for listening to this
video no worries got me
no i got no problems no problems
i can see no
