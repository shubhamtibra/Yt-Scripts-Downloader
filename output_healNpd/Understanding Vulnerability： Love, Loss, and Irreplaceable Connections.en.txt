With the capacity to recognize the
indelible harm we can do to others also
comes recognition of the ways they can
harm us. And that casts our
vulnerability and dependency on those we
care about into stark relief. Unlike
earlier developmental stages where the
lost object can be magically replaced,
denied or split into good and bad parts,
the depressive position involves the
realization that people we love are
whole, irreplaceable and capable of
being hurt by us, just as we ourselves
are whole, irreplaceable, and capable of
being hurt by those we Love.
