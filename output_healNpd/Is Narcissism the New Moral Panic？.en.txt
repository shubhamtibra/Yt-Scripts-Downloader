A recent interaction on my channel left
me feeling uneasy. A commenter posted a
familiar sweeping claim that all
narcissists are abusers. The commenter's
logic was that all narcissists engage in
behaviors like deflecting, emotional
reactivity, and criticizing other
people. And all of these behaviors are
abusive. The commenter also stated quite
directly that I protect these
abusers. I replied by disagreeing with
the characterization, reaffirming that
my channel is about education, not
protecting abusers. I pointed out what I
consider to be errors in the
commenters's logic. Doesn't everyone lie
sometimes? Aren't we all at times
critical of other people? Is everyone
therefore a quote abuser? Context
matters. Frequency matters. the function
of the behavior, the nature of the
relationship, the developmental history
of the person, all of it matters. I
stated my firm belief that we should
judge abuse on a case-byase basis and
that the language of psychology should
be used to clarify and humanize. It
should help us understand people, not
condemn them. I want to be clear that my
response to this person was not
personal. I engaged with their ideas,
not with them as an individual. That's
my practice on this channel. My goal
isn't to attack or criticize people.
It's to invite everyone into a forum
where we can think together. So, I
wasn't prepared for the response. I was
accused of gaslighting, manipulation,
and emotional abuse. Through all of it,
I remained calm and refrained from
engaging in personal attacks of any
kind. Although, I did point out that the
commenter was heavily criticizing and
devaluing me. The commenter then deleted
the entire thread and a post appeared on
another channel dramatically
misrepresenting the exchange and casting
me as someone dangerous, someone who
protects abusers and harms survivors. It
was surreal. The claims were
demonstrably false, but that didn't seem
to matter. The poster seemed convinced
that they had unmasked a narcissist.
This experience and others like it have
made me ask, what exactly is going on
here? What is happening in these online
communities where images of narcissists
are basically burned in effigy? What's
driving the relentless interest in
unmasking, exposing, and denouncing? Why
has so much of this discourse spiraled
into paranoia and
accusation? It all feels strangely
familiar, out of control and out of
touch with reality. It looks a lot like
a moral panic. A moral panic is a
widespread collective response to
something perceived as a threat to
social values or public safety. These
reactions are typically out of
proportion to the actual danger. They
often arise in moments of cultural
anxiety and are fueled by emotionally
charged rhetoric. They divide the world
into binaries, good and evil, safe and
unsafe, victim and predator. The term
itself was coined by sociologist Stanley
Cohen who identified five key features
of a moral panic. One, a perceived
threat to societal norms or values. Two,
media amplification of that threat.
Three, public hostility toward the
perceived offenders. Four, a
disproportionate response compared to
the actual risk. and five, a sense of
consensus that punishes anyone who
deviates from the dominant
narrative. There are many historical
examples of moral panics. In the 1600s,
it was witches. In the 1950s,
communists. In the 1980s, satanic ritual
abuse. In the 1990s and early 2000s, it
was internet predators and HIV stigma.
In each case, there was a grain of
truth, some real concern or social
unease, but it spiraled outward into
distortion and
persecution. So, what happens if we
apply this lens to the current discourse
around
narcissism? Let's take those five
features and walk through each of them
in turn. First, the perceived threat.
The narcissist is portrayed as hidden,
dangerous, manipulative, emotionally
predatory. They may look like anyone,
but inside they're soulless, cold, and
evil. They can't change. They can't
love. The only safe response is to
expose them and cut them
off. Second, media
amplification. Across every platform,
whether it's YouTube, Tik Tok,
Instagram, there are endless videos,
posts, and podcasts all echoing the same
message. The narcissist is everywhere.
They're your boss, your parent, your
partner, your ex. There are red flags,
checklists, tactics for escape. The
content is compelling, emotional, and
over time, it serves to increase
people's sense of paranoia and alarm.
Third, public hostility. Narcissists are
not presented as people with a
personality disorder. They're called
monsters, demons, parasites, or
emotional vampires. They're dehumanized
in ways that would be unthinkable when
discussing almost any other mental
health diagnosis. Fourth, a
disproportionate response. It's become
common to label anyone who criticizes,
lies, forgets a birthday, or shuts down
during a conflict as quote abusive.
Painful relationships are reinterpreted
through the lens of narcissistic abuse.
Common defenses like denial or
projection are recast as moral failings.
Don't like someone, maybe they're a
narc. Had a bad breakup, you were
manipulated by a narc. They're all the
same and they're all abusers. And fifth,
suppression of dissent. If you challenge
this narrative, if you suggest nuance,
if you say that not all narcissists are
abusers and not all abusers are
narcissists, you're accused of
protecting abusers. You're dangerous.
You're a flying monkey, an enabler, an
apologist, or a covert narc who needs to
be
unmasked. These are the hallmarks of a
moral panic. And once you start to see
the pattern, it's
everywhere. But wait, aren't narcissists
actually dangerous? Don't they actually
abuse people? Yes, that's the grain of
truth. Narcissistic traits can
absolutely be harmful. People with NPD
can be emotionally destructive. Some are
abusive. Some are manipulative and
controlling. Some punish other people
for the shame that they can't bear in
themselves. But others live in a state
of chronic self-esteem collapse. Some
struggle with suicidality, addiction, or
self harm. Like every other
psychological condition, narcissism
exists on a spectrum. and pathizing a
group based on the worst examples leads
us away from truth, not toward it. The
danger isn't in identifying harmful or
abusive relationship dynamics. It's in
painting a diverse group of individuals
with a stereotypical brush and
encouraging people with zero
psychological training to armchair
diagnose their spouse or parent or ex as
a narcissist. It's in the fiction that
narcissism always looks a certain way or
is defined by moral failings rather than
emotional and psychological
struggles. What began as an attempt to
name a pattern of relational harm has
now expanded into a galaxy of
disinformation and dangerous moral
certitude. Narcissism is now used to
describe anyone we feel hurt by. Anyone
who doesn't respond the way we want.
Anyone who sets a boundary we don't
like. Anyone who's ambivalent about
whether or not they want to be with us.
Who walks ahead of us. Who has a public
gregarious side and a private
introverted side. Who has a quick temper
or who does that specific thing with
their
eyebrows. The category has become so
elastic that it no longer means
anything. And that is what moral panics
do. They start with something real and
spiral it into something destructive. To
my mind, the defining feature of a moral
panic is its psychological function. It
identifies a scapegoat and offers the
public a way to purge collective shame
and anxiety. It says the badness isn't
in you. It's in that person over there.
We need to help people identify patterns
of behavior that are manipulative,
coercive, or emotionally unsafe. We need
to talk about harm and relational
trauma. But we also need to resist the
collapse of human behavior into narrow
binary categories of good and evil,
victim and abuser. We need to reclaim
psychological language from the grip of
moral outrage. Because not everyone who
hurts you is abusive. Not everyone who
struggles with emotional regulation is a
narcissist and not everyone who
disagrees with you is dangerous. There
are people with narcissistic traits who
want to grow and heal. I work with them
every day. I get emails from people all
over the world who recognize their own
patterns and want to change. People who
are trying to take responsibility to
understand the impact of their behaviors
and to have healthier relationships. And
that process is hard. But it is
possible. And when we cast people
outside the circle of humanity, we make
it harder for anyone to heal. That's the
real cost of moral panic. It simplifies,
it vilifies, and it destroys the
possibility of reflection. What we need
instead is accountability that includes
compassion, boundaries that include
clarity, and a psychological discourse
that can hold more than one truth at the
same time. So, if you find yourself
watching hours and hours of content
about narcissists, content that tells
you how to hurt them, how to expose
them, how to make them suffer, then I
invite you to take a step back. Ask
yourself if it's actually helping you to
grow, or if it's really just giving you
the thrill of feeling right, the feeling
of superiority, the temporary relief of
projection.
The way forward is through complexity,
nuance, and compassion. The world isn't
black and white. It's gray. As I said to
the commenter, there's a desire to
create rigid categories of us and them.
But they are us and we are
them. Okay, so that's it for today.
Until next time, take good care.
