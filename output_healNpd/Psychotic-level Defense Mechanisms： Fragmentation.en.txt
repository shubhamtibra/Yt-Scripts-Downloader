Psychotic fragmentation. This is when
self-image, object images, and the links
between them become fragmented. Such
fragmentation produces a disorganized
and confused narrative. It involves
total splitting between multiple self
states, fracturing the person into
countless pieces that can't be easily
linked together. Someone utilizing this
defense may appear to ramble
incoherently, to vacasillate between
sudden and frighteningly intense
feelings and perceptions, or to
construct narratives that seem to
contain numerous conflicting organizing
themes.
