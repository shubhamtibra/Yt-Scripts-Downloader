over time these patterns of interactions
are organized into something called
internal working models these are
unconscious expectations about how Human
Relationships work there's an internal
working model for the self and there's a
corresponding internal working model of
other people these internal working
models combine in predictable ways to
form attachment patterns in early
childhood attachment patterns are
observable measurable and relatively
consistent throughout development
they can be correlated with all sorts of
outcomes
