all pathological narcissists fluctuate
between periods of grandiosity and
vulnerability the guy who seems
completely full of himself and like he
has an unrealistically positive
self-image likely goes through private
periods of breakdown and vulnerability
the same goes for the quietly depressed
narcissist who has an unrealistically
negative self-image that person likely
goes through intense periods of
grandiosity and inflated self-esteem
