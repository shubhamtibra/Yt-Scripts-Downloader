In contrast to the paranoid schizoid
position that underlies most psychotic
and borderline functioning, the term for
the mode of experiencing that most often
underlies neurotic functioning is the
depressive position. So-called because
loss and grief become much more
difficult to deny. In this position, the
individual can no longer project badness
outward or split the self and other
people into good and bad parts. As a
result, the individual must confront
painful grief, loss, and disappointment.
Experiences that were previously denied,
displaced, or externalized.
