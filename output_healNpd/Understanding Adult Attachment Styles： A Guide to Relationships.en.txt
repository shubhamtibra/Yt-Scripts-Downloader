Childhood attachment patterns eventually
turn into adult attachment patterns.
This chart shows the four adult
attachment styles and how they relate to
underlying internal working models of
the self and of other people. On the
x-axis is model of self which is also
sometimes called attachment anxiety and
on the y ais is model of others which is
also sometimes called attachment
avoidance. These dimensions of
attachment anxiety and attachment
avoidance combined to form four
prototypical adult attachment patterns.
