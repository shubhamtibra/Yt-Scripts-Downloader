Hi everyone, welcome to Weekly Insights.
There's a growing claim out there,
sometimes in academic writing, but more
often in online commentary, that
narcissistic personality disorder, or
NPD, is almost entirely genetic. Some
recent authors have even suggested
heritability rates as high as 80%.
So today I want to take a closer look at
that claim. Not to deny that genes play
some role in personality development,
but to question what it really means
when we say that a condition is genetic
and whether that claim holds up when
applied to
NPD. So let's begin with the most
generous reading of this view.
Narcissistic traits, like many
personality traits, do show some degree
of heritability. Twin studies have found
moderate genetic contributions to traits
like antagonism, impulsivity,
extraversion, and low agreeableness. And
these are traits that are sometimes
considered proximal to narcissistic
functioning. For example, a 2014 twin
study in plus one found that grandiosity
had a heritability of about 23% and
entitlement of about 35%.
To be fair, this figure is not
insignificant, but it falls well short
of genetic
determinism. There are also findings
from research using the five factor
model showing that narcissism correlates
with high extraversion and low
agreeableness, both of which show
moderate
heritability. But inheriting a tendency
toward boldness or antagonism isn't the
same thing as developing a personality
disorder. The presence of a trait is not
equivalent to the presence of a
syndrome. Unfortunately, this modest
heritability is sometimes extrapolated
into sweeping deterministic claims. And
more troublingly, these claims are often
made without a full understanding of
what NPD actually is, its essential
features, its complexity, and how it's
accurately assessed.
One of the most common arguments used to
support the idea of a primarily genetic
origin is brain imaging. Some studies
have found differences in brain
structure and function in individuals
with narcissistic traits, especially in
the prefrontal cortex and the anterior
insula. These regions are involved in
empathy, emotion regulation, and
self-awareness. For example, a 2013
study published in the Journal of
Psychiatric Research found reduced gray
matter volume in the left anterior
insula in individuals diagnosed with
NPD. But here we need to pause. The
existence of neural differences doesn't
tell us why those differences exist,
only that they do. There's an assumption
that if something appears on a brain
scan, it must be genetically caused. But
that's not actually how neurodevelopment
works.
The brain is exquisitely plastic. It's
shaped as much by experience as by
inherited structure. Neurons that fire
together wire together is a central
principle of experience dependent
plasticity. When emotional expression is
met with rejection or indifference or
when vulnerability is punished rather
than comforted, the child adapts and
those adaptations become neural
patterns. Defensive postures like
emotional constriction, vigilance, or
performative self-presentation shape the
developing brain and over time they will
show up in imaging studies. But that
doesn't mean that they started there.
In fact, a 2023 study found that
emotional neglect was correlated with
structural changes in brain regions that
are critical for social cognition and
empathy, notably the anterior insula,
the very same region implicated in
empathy deficits among individuals with
narcissistic features. These neural
alterations highlight the impact of
early emotional neglect on the
development of brain areas that are
essential for emotional awareness and
interpersonal understanding. And we have
growing empirical support for the
importance of early relational
experience in the development of
narcissistic traits. For example, atwe
and vnoli in 2006 found that both
emotional coldness and excessive
parental overvaluation predicted higher
narcissism scores in adulthood. Horton
and colleagues also in 2006 similarly
found that low parental warmth combined
with unrealistic or inflated praise was
associated with later narcissistic
traits. And a 2015 longitudinal study
demonstrated that parental
overvaluation, that is treating children
as inherently more special or entitled
than others, significantly predicted the
emergence of narcissistic traits over
time.
These findings are consistent with the
long-standing clinical understanding
that narcissistic pathology develops
through a complex interplay of
constitutional vulnerability and early
relational failures, not through genetic
transmission alone.
So, while it's true that individuals
with narcissistic traits show
differences in brain regions that are
associated with things like empathy or
self-awareness, to suggest that these
are genetic causes rather than
developmental consequences is a leap
that simply isn't justified by the
evidence. The deeper problem with these
genetic arguments is that they often
begin from a distorted view of what NPD
actually is.
Too often NPD is reduced to traits like
arrogance, entitlement, or lack of
empathy. And if that's all there was,
then sure, it might be easier to argue
for a neurobiological substrate. But
that's not what NPD is. For example,
numerous studies of narcissism are still
using the narcissistic personality
inventory or NPI as their main indicator
of pathological narcissism. The problem
here, as I've discussed in previous
videos, is that the NPI doesn't measure
pathological narcissism. It largely
measures disagreeable but adaptive
traits like extraversion, confidence,
and socially aggressive behaviors. And
these aren't NPD. They fall well short
of capturing anything specific to NPD.
Even a cursory search through recent
articles brought up a study from 2021
that correlated high NPI scores with
differences in preffrontal brain
structure, drawing erroneous conclusions
in the process. NPD is a deeply
conflicted internally unstable
condition. The diagnosis itself has long
been controversial. In fact, it was
nearly eliminated from the DSM5 in 2013
due to poor empirical grounding, low
interrator reliability, and limited
clinical utility. It remains one of the
least reliably diagnosed personality
disorders in the manual.
The DSM criteria prioritize overt traits
like grandiosity, fantasies of success,
and need for admiration while largely
ignoring the vulnerable core that has
been extensively documented in the
clinical literature. NPD isn't arrogance
or confidence or even low empathy. And
studies that isolate those traits and
then call them quote narcissism are
incomplete at best and misleading at
worst. The vulnerable core of NPD is
vital to understanding and accurately
identifying the disorder. It includes
chronic shame, unstable self-esteem,
social withdrawal, depression, and even
suicidality. People with narcissistic
personality pathology often feel like
impostors in their own lives. And this
is where the genetic narrative begins to
fall apart. Because are we really to
believe that a specific genetic
combination reliably produces both
crushing self-doubt and highly complex
compensatory defenses? Both low
selfworth and the grandiose systems that
prop it up. That's not how genetics
works. It's certainly not how
personality development works. For
decades, psychonamic clinicians have
described early environments commonly
seen in people with narcissistic
pathology. Homes where emotional
attunement was inconsistent or absent,
where achievement was rewarded more than
presence, where normal needs for care,
validation, and vulnerability were
treated as shameful or weak. Hines Kohut
called this the failure of empathic
mirroring. Otto Kernberg wrote of
parental figures who were themselves
fragile, punitive, or emotionally
unavailable. And James Mastersonson
described the conflict between the real
self and the false self in the
narcissistic
personality. In all of these
formulations, narcissism is not a trait.
Rather, it's a defensive solution, a way
of maintaining psychic cohesion in the
absence of adequate relational support.
And in my own clinical experience with
over a decade of specializing in
pathological narcissism and NPD, I have
never encountered someone with a full
syndrome presentation of NPD who did not
describe significant emotional neglect
or relational trauma. Not one. That's
anecdotal, of course, but it is
anecdotally consistent with nearly every
clinical theory of narcissistic
development that we have.
So let's compare this now with something
like Alzheimer's disease. We don't have
all the pieces, but we do understand
Alzheimer's to be a biologically based
condition. We've identified genetic
markers like the APOE4 gene that
reliably increase risk. We can image the
brain. We know the course of progression
and we can reliably and verifiably
diagnose it. And yet, even with all
that, our best estimate for heritability
is only about 40 to 50%. The rest comes
from environment, things like lifestyle,
vascular health, inflammation, and diet.
So, how do we get from 40% heritability
in a medically defined biomarker
supported condition like Alzheimer's to
80% heritability in a poorly defined
non-biological socially shaped syndrome
like NPD? Where are the genes? Where's
the imaging evidence? Where's the
consensus? It's simply not there. It
sounds authoritative to say that
something is genetic, but it's often
used to shut down inquiry rather than
promote it. It flattens complexity. It
lets us ignore context. It lets us say,
"Well, this is just how they are. They
were born that way." But that's not what
the science says. Genes matter.
Temperament matters. But narcissistic
personality pathology emerges from an
ongoing recursive relational process.
It's shaped by how we're met in our
vulnerability when we're young, how
we're seen or not seen, how we're loved
or not loved. To suggest that NPD is
almost entirely genetic is to ignore the
heart of the disorder and to invalidate
the very real suffering that people with
NPD have experienced, the tragic
neglect, abuse, and trauma that
contributes substantially to its
development. I won't claim to understand
why people feel so motivated to adopt
the stance that NPD is almost entirely
genetic. Maybe it's just a simple answer
to a complex question and people find
that easier to
swallow. But the real answer is that we
simply don't know. We can't identify
genetic markers, brain pathways, or
neurochemical imbalances for most forms
of mental illness. We simply don't
understand the brain as well as we'd
like. And I think lots of people are
frightened by that ambiguity. But when
we're faced with not knowing, we
shouldn't respond by making up
comforting answers.
Someday we might develop a coherent
brainbased model for mental illnesses
like NPD, but that day remains somewhere
in the
future. Okay, so that's it for today. As
