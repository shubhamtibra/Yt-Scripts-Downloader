Are we held often enough? Are we fed
when hungry? Is it warm enough? Does
caregiving occur predictably and
consistently, allowing us to discern
patterns in the sensations that we
experience? Or are we left crying for
hours, overwhelmed by hunger, cold, and
isolation?
These early experiences, consistent
responsive care versus neglect and
disorganization, shape the first layers
of self-image, forming the foundation of
our eventual adult identities.
