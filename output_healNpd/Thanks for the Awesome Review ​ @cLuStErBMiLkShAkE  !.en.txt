hi everyone Dr Mark eatonson here just
making a quick video today to give a
shout out and my gratitude to Cluster B
milkshake who recently reviewed my book
uh and I have to say honestly I think
it's my favorite review of my book that
I've ever seen uh it's authentic it's
vulnerable it's funny it's profane I
loved every minute of it so thank you so
much for making that for recommending
the book to your audience I look forward
to checking out more of your channel and
I encourage anybody who's watching this
to do so as well so thanks again have a
Happy Thanksgiving and take good care
