We love people because of their
imperfections, not in spite of them.
Their idiosyncrasies, struggles, and
limitations are part of their history.
You have a history, and so do I. And
neither of us can change it. We can
however shape the narrative of that
history so that it emphasizes
resiliency, growth and connection.
