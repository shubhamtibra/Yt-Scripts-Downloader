hey everyone Dr edenson here just making
a quick video to let you know about a
recent interview I did over on the
nameless narcissists YouTube channel and
if you're not familiar with his stuff
it's a fascinating first person
perspective on the experience of NPD so
I was happy to speak with him his
content on his channel is very well
informed and we cover some good
territory the interview lasts just over
an hour so if you got the time I
encourage you to head over there give it
a watch and then head back over here and
post any comments or questions you have
down below okay thanks for watching and
take good care
