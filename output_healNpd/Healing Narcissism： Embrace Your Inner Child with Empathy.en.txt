narcissism is about hidden pain and the
antidote is empathy you can extend that
empathy to yourself find the hurt child
inside the suit of armor discover the
basic goodness of that child witness the
pressure that child feels to be perfect
self-sufficient and without emotional
needs instead of rejecting or punishing
that child for existing inside of you
try to treat that child with compassion
and
love and see what happens
