The paranoid schizoid position is thus
actually a hopeful one, a mode of
experiencing that seeks to protect the
possibility of goodness both in the
child and the outside world. By
separating experience into good and bad
parts, the child can ensure that some
good always survives even in the face of
overwhelming pain.
The coexistence of the paranoid schizoid
in depressive positions is a crucial
point with significant implications for
treatment and healing.
