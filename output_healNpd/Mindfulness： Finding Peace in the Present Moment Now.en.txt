Mindfulness and present moment
awareness. This practice involves
sitting with your thoughts, feelings,
and sensations as they arise and
choosing simply to let them be. Don't
pull them close and don't push them
away. Treat them more like actors on a
stage, each with a role to play. They
appear, they recite their lines, and
then they exit to make space for a new
actor with new lines and a different
role in the story. You don't need to
accept everything they say as truth.
